# Class 1

# Berry Picking

So we're trying to get the maximum number of berries for Bessie, which means we need to minimize the number of berries that Elsie receives. 

So let Q be the minimum number of berries that Elsie will get in one of her buckets. Then WLOG we can also assume that all of her buckets will contain exactly b berries (in the ideal situation, which is what we want to create). 

So now that we know this is the scenario we need to make, we have to figure out how to maximize the number of berries placed into K buckets whose size is at max Q, so that at least K/2 buckets have exactly Q berries inside. 

For any tree, every bucket will have exactly b berries except for one at max.

So then you just fill buckets from each tree with b berries until you run out of buckets, or every tree has less than Q berries remaining. If at that point you still have some buckets you need to fill, then sort the trees from highest to lowest (in terms of berries) and fill up the buckets. 

Do this for values of Q from 0 to the max number of berries on a tree, and figure out which value of Q gives Bessie the most berries then output the number of berries Bessie gets.

Like I mentioned in class we have to pay attention to the transition periods between Y.

You can find the transition periods in O(1) time which is ultra fast.

The smallest you can give is 1 then 2

so 

1 + 2  + 3 + .... + 5 + k =  (close enough) k^2 â‰¥ N

so k = sqrt(N)
