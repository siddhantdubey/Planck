# Sohom

Needs help with:

- Prefix Sums (2D Prefix sums specifically)
- Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Floodfill)
- Needs to learn how to find the diameter of a tree and just have a better understanding of graph theory in general

Tutoring Plan:

- I walk through problems in front of him
- Ask him for questions he struggled with and work through them in front of him
