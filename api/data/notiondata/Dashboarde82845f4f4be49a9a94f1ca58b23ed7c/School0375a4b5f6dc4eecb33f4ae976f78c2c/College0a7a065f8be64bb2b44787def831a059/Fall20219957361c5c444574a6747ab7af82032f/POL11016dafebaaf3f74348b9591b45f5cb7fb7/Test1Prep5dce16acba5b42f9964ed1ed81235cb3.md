# Sample Questions

- **What are the principles of the US Constitution? How many amendments are there and generally what do they cover?**
    - I know what the amendments are. Easy reference available online as well.
- **Define federalism. In your own words explain what this structure of government means for how public issues are addressed and how public policy gets made in the U.S. context**
    - A mixed form of government where the federal government has a lot of say but each state/local government also has their own rights to legislate themselves. This does lead to conflict with legislation over certain topics as the Federal government may have one stance on a topic while the states could have many different opinions from state to state, with some agreeing with the fed and some not.
- **What types of powers do the federal and state governments have? Which are distinct and which do they share? What are the terms to describe these powers?**
    - Exclusive/Reserved powers: Powers that only one of them has
    - Concurrent powers: Powers that they share
    - Easily available list of the powers they have, no need to memorize
- **Federalism -- What are its origins and purpose? What are its Constitutional foundations? How has federalism shifted over time?**
    - Origins from the constitutional convention, alexander hamilton was a big advocate.
    - Wanted to be sure the Federal government was strong so that United States were not weak like they were during Shay's rebellion which was even caused by their inability to tax leading to them not being able to pay soldiers.
    - Constitutional foundations lie in the powers that are granted to the federal gov and the powers that are reserved for the states.
    - Federalism has shifted over time by going from very clearly delineated powers for the federal state and local governments to a blurring of the boundary lines that leads to a lot of conflict in addition to collaboration in between all levels of government.
- **What are the different forms of federalism? How did they develop in relation to grants? What are some examples of federalism (current policy issues)? Can you think of a policy area where states led the way and the U.S. national policy followed?**
    - Dual federalism: Giving limited list of powers primary foreign policy and national defense to the national government. Other powers to states.
    - Cooperative federalism: When national, state, and local governments work together to make the government easier.
    - Centralized gov: fed gov has all the power
    - Competitive Federalism: When state and local governments compete for different powers over policies, and people then choose which region they live under.
    - "NEW" Federalism: Anything not in the constitution is a reserved power for the states.
    - Current federalism: Marijuana, COVID-19, Abortion (ig)
    - Civil rights policies, separate but equal was outlawed in Iowa 86 years before the rest of the country.
- **What are the implications of federalism for how policy develops? What about how it matters for individuals? How have civil rights been affected by federalism?**
    - Because of federalism, it is possible that people in different states will have vastly different experiences and rights. For example, someone in a state that has Marijuana outlawed could get many years in prison for possessing some, while someone in a state with it legalized for recreational use would be just fine, because different states view the issue differently. Additionally if someone from a state where it was legal took some to Washington D.C, they'd get arrested because Marijuana is not legalized federally.
    - Federalism affects the development of policy by showing state and local governments that they have control over their own legislation, and it allows them to challenge nationwide laws/mandates if they believe to be unconstitutional. This has been exhibited a lot during the past year over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. States and local governments have been challenging things like the mask mandates that were created by the Federal government earlier this year, and taken those to court multiple times. This slows the development of policy and makes society worse for the individual by negatively affecting public health.
    - It also infringes on civil rights by affecting public health.
- **What does ad hoc federalism mean? What is an example of that and what does it illustrate? What do you think are some of the most striking examples of federalism? What do they illustrate?**
    - Ad hoc federalism is the process of choosing a state-centered or nation centered federalism on the basis of political convivence. Essentially, it is picking and choosing when something is under the jurisdiction of a state or the federal government for political posturing.
    - This implies that federalism is applied by those who have the majority political power, and they pick and choose based on whether it benefits them or not.
    - During Obama's presidency, conservatives resisted many of his liberal policies in areas like immigration, arguing that the federal government was unconstitutionally overreaching. This is an example of ad-hoc federalism, as if it were a Republican president, the republican governors would most likely not have challenged policies that aligned with their beliefs.
    - covid-19 is a striking example of federalism.
- **Political culture -- What shapes it and what are Elazar's arguments and framework? What policies would we expect from states in each of Elezarâ€™s categories?**
    - Elazar argues that political culture is shaped by the culture of the people that initially settled in the state. For example, in New England states that were settled by Puritans who wanted to build their "city on the hill", they now have a moralistic political culture. Other states could be traditionalist, individualist, or moralist as well.
    - Moralist: You would expect to see policies for social good, they support expanded role for government and want social welfare usually. Likely to agree with democratic policies.
    - Individualist: People interact with the government as they would interact with a marketplace, they like tax breaks. Voters are loyal to the candidates that they share party affiliation with.
    - Traditionalist: Government enforces the status quo, likely agrees with conservative policies. The south.
