## Dynamic Binding and Polymorphism

- **What is dynamic binding?**
    - A method may be implemented in several classes along the inheritance chain. The JVM decides which method is invoked at runtime. This is known as dynamic binding.

    - a) Person \n Student
    - b) Person \n Person
    
    For (a), new Person().printPerson() invokes the printPerson() method defined in the Person class, which then invokes the getInfo() method in the Person class. new Student().printPerson() invokes the printPerson() method defined in the Person class, which then invokes the getInfo() method in the Student class, because the calling object is a Student.
    
    For (b), new Student().printPerson() invokes the printPerson() method defined in the Person class, which then invokes the getInfo() method in the Person class. It does not invoke the getInfo() method in the Student class, because it is private and can only be invoked from a method in the Student class. Note that the getInfo() method is not overridden because it is private. You can only override a non-private method such as getInfo() in (a).

    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - i from A is 40
    - i from A  is 60
    - i from B is 60
    

## Interfaces

- **Suppose A is an interface? Can you create an instance using new A()?**
    - Nope. But if a class B implements A then you can do this.
        - A a = new B();
- **Suppose A is an interface. Can you declare a reference variable x with type A like this? A x;**
    - Yes.
- **Which of the following is a correct interface? Open toggle to see.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%203.png)
    
    - a) is *not valid* because the print method has a body
    - b) is not valid because the interface cannot use the abstract keyword
    - c) is not valid because the interface cannot use the abstract keyword
    - d) is valid because public + method with no body
    - e) valid because public + default method
    - f) valid because public + static method
- **Show the error in the following code. Open toggle to see.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%204.png)
    
    The method in the class must be declared public because all methods defined in an interface are public. When a class implements the interface, the method must be declared public.
    

## Comparable

- **True or false? If a class implements Comparable, the object of the class can invoke the compareTo method.**
    - True
- **Which of the following is the correct method header for the compareTo method in the String class? Open toggle to see.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%205.png)
    
    - the first one
- **Can the following code be compiled? Why?**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%206.png)
    
    - no because n2 is not of type Integer
- **You can define the compareTo method in a class without implementing the Comparable interface. What are the benefits of implementing the Comparable interface?**
    - By implementing the Comparable interface, the object of the class can be passed to a method that requires a Comparable type.

## ArrayList (Chapter 11)

- **How do you do the following? Open toggle.**
    - Create an ArrayList for storing double values?
        - ArrayList<Double>() doublelist = new ArrayList<Double>();
    - Append an object to a list?
        - list.add(object)
    - Insert an object at the beginning of a list?
        - list.add(0, object o)
    - Find the number of objects in a list?
        - list.size()
    - Remove a given object from a list?
        - list.remove(object)
    - Remove the last object from the list?
        - list.remove(list.size() - 1)
    - Check whether a given object is in a list?
        - list.contains(object o)
    - Retrieve an object at a specified index from a list?
        - list.get(i)
- **Suppose the ArrayList list contains {"Dallas", "Dallas", "Houston", "Dallas"}. What is the list after invoking list.remove("Dallas") one time? Does the following code correctly remove all elements with value "Dallas" from the list? If not, correct the code. Open to see code.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%207.png)
    
    - No it will not. Because i < list.size() will fail when you get to the last dallas.
    - So you must do this
        
        ```java
        for (int i = 0; i < list.size(); i++) {
        	if (list.remove("Dallas"))
        		i--;
        }
        ```
        
- **Explain why the following code displays [1, 3] rather [2, 3]. Open toggle to see code.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%208.png)
    
    - The reason is because it is removing the element at index 1 which happens to be 2, not the number 1.
    - To remove the integer value 3 from this list, you can remove the element at index 2. So by doing list.remove(2).
    - To do it for a more general list you can do list.remove(Integer.valueOf(3));

## ArrayList (Chapter 19)

- **Are there any compile errors in (a) and (b)? Open toggle to see code.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%209.png)
    
    a will compile, but b will not compile because the dates array was declared to take type Date and cannot take a String
    
- **What is wrong in (a)? Is the code in (b) correct? Open toggle to see code.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%2010.png)
    
    - you need to cast in A
    - the code in b is correct because of the use of generics
    
- **Since you create an instance of ArrayList of strings using new ArrayList<String>(), should the constructor in the ArrayList class be defined as public ArrayList<E>().**
    - No.

## Asymptotic Functions / Big O

- **Why is a constant factor ignored in the Big O notation? Why is a non-dominating term ignored in the Big O notation?**
    - This is because the constant factor is irrelevant at measuring the growth rate of the time complexity function. The dominating term grows much faster than the non-dominating term which is why the non-dominating firm is ignored.
- **How many stars are displayed in the following code if n is 10? How many if n is 20? Use the Big O notation to estimate the time complexity. Open toggle to see.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%2011.png)
    
    - a) O(n), prints 10 times for 10, prints 20 times for 20
    - b) O(n^2), prints 100 times, prints 400 times for 20
    - c) O(n^3), prints 1000 times, prints 8000 times for 20
    - d) O(n^2), prints 1000 times for 10, prints 4000 times for 20
- **Use the Big O notation to estimate the time complexity of the following methods. Open toggle to see.**
    
    ![Untitled](Exam%203%20Prep%2014487992ac714e0d8f78d4ae658e849f/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    - a) O(n)
    - b) O(n^2)
    - c) O(n)
    - d) O(n^2)
    
- **Design an O(n) time algorithm for computing the sum of numbers from n1 to n2 for (n1 < n2). Can you design an O(1) for performing the same task?**
    - The methods are in this toggle.
        
        ```java
        //O(n) algorithm
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i=n1; i <= n2; i++) {
        	sum += i;
        }
        
        //O(1) algorithm
        sum = ((n1 + n2)/(2)) * (n2 - n1 + 1)
        ```
        
- **Put the following growth functions in order, 5n^3/4032, 44logn, 10nlogn, 500, 2n^2, 2^n / 45, 3n**
    - 500, 44logn, 3n, 10nlogn, 2n^2, 5n^3/4032, 2^n/45

## Sorting Chapter 7

- **Apply selection-sort to {3.4, 5, 3, 3.5, 2.2, 1.9, 2} and explain how selectionSort works.**
    - 1.9, 5, 3, 3.5, 2.2, 3.4, 2
    - 1.9, 2, 3, 3.5, 2.2, 3.4, 5
    - 1.9, 2, 2.2, 3.5, 3, 3.4, 5
    - 1.9, 2, 2.2, 3, 3.5, 3.4, 5
    - 1.9, 2, 2.2, 3, 3.4, 3.5, 5
    - Selection sort works by keep track of two subarrays essentially. One is the already sorted, and the other is to be sorted array.
    - First, it will go through the whole array, find the minimum element and then put that at index 0
    - Then it will go from 1, to the end of the array, find the minimum element and then put that at index 1 and so on and so forth until is has looped through the entire array.
    
    ```java
    void selectionSort(int arr[]) {
    	int n = arr.length;
    	for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {
    		int min_idx = i; //where to put the minimum element of the subarray
    		for (int j=i + 1; j < n; j++) {
    			if arr[j] < arr[min_idx] {
    				min_idx = j;
    			}
    		}
    		//swap the minimum element with the element that is currently first in the portion
    		int temp = arr[min_idx];
    		arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
    		arr[i] = temp;
    	}
    }
    ```
    
- **How do you modify the selectionSort method to sort numbers in decreasing order?**
    - Instead of finding the smallest number, go to find the largest number in the remaining subarray

## Sorting Chapter 23

- **Apply Insertion Sort to {45, 11, 50, 59, 60, 2, 4, 7, 10} and explain how insertionSort works.**
    - 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 2, 4, 7, 10
    - 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 2, 4, 7, 10
    - 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 2, 4, 7, 10
    - 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 2, 4, 7, 10
    - 2, 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 4, 7, 10
    - 2, 4, 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 7, 10
    - 2, 4, 7, 11, 45, 50, 59, 60, 10
    - 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, 45, 50, 59, 60
    - Insertion sort works the following way to sort an array of size n in ascending order:
        - Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array
        - Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
        - If the key element is smaller than its predecessors, compare it to the elements before.
        - Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element (the key element) that will find its correct position in the sorted array.
    
- **If the list is already sorted, how many comparisons will the insertionSort method perform?**
    - n - 1 comparisons
- **Describe how a bubble sort works. What is the time complexity for a bubble sort?**
    - It repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
    - The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2)
    
    ```java
    void bubbleSort(int arr[]) {
    	int n = arr.length();
    	for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
    		for (int j=0; j < n-i-1; j++) {
    			if arr[j] > arr[j+1]{
    				int temp = arr[j];
    				arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
    				arr[j + 1] = temp;
    			}
    		}
    	}
    ```
    
- **Describe how a merge sort works. What is the time complexity for a merge sort?**
    - A merge sort works by splitting an array into two halves recursively, sorting the split arrays and then merging them back together.
    
    ```java
    void merge(int arr[], int l, int m, int r)
        {
            // Find sizes of two subarrays to be merged
            int n1 = m - l + 1;
            int n2 = r - m;
      
            /* Create temp arrays */
            int L[] = new int[n1];
            int R[] = new int[n2];
      
            /*Copy data to temp arrays*/
            for (int i = 0; i < n1; ++i)
                L[i] = arr[l + i];
            for (int j = 0; j < n2; ++j)
                R[j] = arr[m + 1 + j];
      
            /* Merge the temp arrays */
      
            // Initial indexes of first and second subarrays
            int i = 0, j = 0;
      
            // Initial index of merged subarray array
            int k = l;
            while (i < n1 && j < n2) {
                if (L[i] <= R[j]) {
                    arr[k] = L[i];
                    i++;
                }
                else {
                    arr[k] = R[j];
                    j++;
                }
                k++;
            }
      
            /* Copy remaining elements of L[] if any */
            while (i < n1) {
                arr[k] = L[i];
                i++;
                k++;
            }
      
            /* Copy remaining elements of R[] if any */
            while (j < n2) {
                arr[k] = R[j];
                j++;
                k++;
            }
        }
      
        // Main function that sorts arr[l..r] using
        // merge()
        void sort(int arr[], int l, int r)
        {
            if (l < r) {
                // Find the middle point
                int m =l+ (r-l)/2;
      
                // Sort first and second halves
                sort(arr, l, m);
                sort(arr, m + 1, r);
      
                // Merge the sorted halves
                merge(arr, l, m, r);
            }
        }
    ```

- **What is a checked exception, and what is an unchecked exception?**
    - A checked exception is checked at compile time and will throw an error if not handled properly while unchecked exceptions are at runtime. All unchecked exceptions inherit from RunTimeException. A checked exception must be explicitly declared in a method eclaration if a method throws it.
    
- **How do you throw an exception? Can you throw multiple exceptions in one throw statement?**
    - You do it like this
    
    ```java
    private void method(int a) throws FileNotFoundException, IOException {
    	
    }
    
    //in a method
    
    throw new FileNotFoundException("FILE NOT FOUND RUH ROH");
    ```
    
    - You cannot throw multiple exceptions in one throw statement.
- **What is the keyword throw used for? What is the keyword throws used for?**
    - The keyword throw is used to throw an exception and the keyword throws is for claiming exceptions.
- **What does the method getMessage() do?**
    - the getMessage() is defined in the Throwable class to return a string that describes the exception.
- **What does the method printStackTrace() do?**
    - Displays all trace information to the console.

- **How do you check whether a file already exists? How do you delete a file? How do you rename a file? Can you find the file size using the File class? How do you create a directory?**
    - To check whether a file already exists use the f.exists() method.
    - To delete a file use the .delete() method.
    - Use the .renameTo(File) to rename a file.
    - Use .length() to return the file size in bytes.
    - Use f.mkdir() to create a directory under a file object if File f = new File("C:\\Poggers") or some other filepath
- **Can you use the File class for I/O? Does creating a File object create a file on the disk?**
    - No and No.
- **How do you create a PrintWriter to write data to a file?**
    - PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(fileName);
