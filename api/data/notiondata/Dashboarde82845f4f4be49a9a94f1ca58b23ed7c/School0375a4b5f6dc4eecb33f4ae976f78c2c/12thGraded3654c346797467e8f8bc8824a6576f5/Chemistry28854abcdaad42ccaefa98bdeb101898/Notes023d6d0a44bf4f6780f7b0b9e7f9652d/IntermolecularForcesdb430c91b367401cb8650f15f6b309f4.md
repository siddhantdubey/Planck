# Intermolecular Forces

Revised: No
Tags: Unit 3

- **What are Intermolecular Forces?**
    - The forces that exist between molecules in a covalently bonded substance.
    - Breaking these forces causes covalent substances to change phases.
- **Types of Intermolecular Forces**
    - **Dipole-Dipole Forces**
        - These forces occur between polar molecules: The positive end of one polar molecule is attracted to the negative end of another polar molecule.
        - Molecules with greater polarity will have greater dipole-dipole attractions, so molecules with larger dipole moments tend to have higher melting and boiling points.
        - These forces are relatively weak and these substances melt and boil at very low temperatures.
        - Most substances held together by these forces are gases or liquids at room temperature.
    - **Hydrogen Bonds**
        - Hydrogen bonds are a special type of dipole-dipole attraction. In a hydrogen bond, the positively charged hydrogen end of a molecule is attracted to the negatively charged end of another molecule containing an extremely electronegative element (fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen)
        - **Much stronger than dipole-dipole forces**
        - Substances that have hydrogen bonds, such as water and ammonia, have higher melting and boiling points than substances that are held together only by other types of intermolecular forces.
    - **London Dispersion Forces**
        - These forces occur between all molecules.
        - Very weak attractions.
        - More molecules = Greater London Dispersion Forces
        - So more electrons = higher melting and boiling points
        - Substances that experience only London dispersion forces melt and boil at extremely low temperatures.
- **Bond Strength**
    - Ionic substances are generally solids at room temperature, and turning them into liquids, requires the bonds holding the lattice together to be broken. The amount of energy needed for that is based on the Coulombic attraction between the molecules.
    - Covalent substances
        - Liquid at room temperature
        - Will boil when the intermolecular forces between them are broken
        - For molecules with similar sizes, the following IMF ranking can help you determine the relative strength of the IMFs within the molecules
            1. Hydrogen Bonds
            2. Non-hydrogen bond permanent dipoles
            3. London Dispersion forces
                1. Larger molecules are more polarizable and have stronger London dispersion forces
    - The melting and boiling points of covalent substances are almost always lower than the melting and boiling point of ionic ones.
    - Metallic bonding tends to be very strong and thus metals tend to have high melting points.
    - Network covalent bonding is the strongest type of bonding there is and it is very difficult to get substances that exhibit network covalent bonding to melt.
- **Bonding and Phases**
    - The phase of a substance is directly related to the strength of its intermolecular forces.
