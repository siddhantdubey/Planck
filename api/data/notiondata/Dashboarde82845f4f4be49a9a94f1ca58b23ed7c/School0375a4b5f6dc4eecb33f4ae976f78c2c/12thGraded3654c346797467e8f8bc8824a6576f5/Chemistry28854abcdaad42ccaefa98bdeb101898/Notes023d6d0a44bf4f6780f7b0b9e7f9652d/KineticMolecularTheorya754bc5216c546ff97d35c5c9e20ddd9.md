# Kinetic Molecular Theory

Revised: No
Tags: Unit 3

For ideal gases, the following assumptions can be made:

- The kinetic energy of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.
- If several different gases are present in a sample at a given temperature, all the gases will have the same average kinetic energy.
- The volume of an ideal gas particle is insignificant when compared with the volume in which the gas is contained.
- There are no forces of attraction between the gas molecules in an ideal gas.
- Gas molecules are in constant motion, colliding with one another and with the walls of their container without losing any energy.
