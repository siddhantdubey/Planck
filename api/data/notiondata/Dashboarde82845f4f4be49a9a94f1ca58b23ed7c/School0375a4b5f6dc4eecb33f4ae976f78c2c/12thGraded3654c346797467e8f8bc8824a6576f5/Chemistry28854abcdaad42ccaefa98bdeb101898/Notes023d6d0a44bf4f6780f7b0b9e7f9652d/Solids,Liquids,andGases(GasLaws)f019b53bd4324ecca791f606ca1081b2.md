- **Maxwell-Boltzmann Diagrams**
    - This diagram shows the range of velocities for molecules of a gas.
    - Molecules at a given temperature are not all moving at the same velocity.
    - When determining the temp we take the average velocity of all the molecules and use that in the relevant equation to calculate temperature.

    - As you can see, the higher the temp of the gas, the larger the range is for the velocities of the individual molecules.
    - Maxwell-Boltzmann diagrams are also used to show a number of different gases at the same temperature.
    - Not all of the atoms will have the same mass but the kinetic energy of the gases is the same because they are at the same temperature. So the velocities must change in order to ensure that is true.

- **Effusion**
    - Effusion is the rate at which a gas will escape from a container through microscopic holes in the surface of the container.
    - The rate at which a gas effuses from a container is dependent on the speed of the gas particles. The faster the particles are moving, the more often they hit the sides of the container, and the more likely they are to hit a hole and escape.
    - So the rate of effusion thus increases with temperature, but also, if examining gases at the same temperature, the gas with the lower molar mass will effuse first.
- **Gas Laws**
    - **The Ideal Gas Equation**
        - $PV = nRT$
        - P = pressure of the gas, V = the volume of the gas
        - n = the number of moles of gas
        - R = the gas constant, 0.0821 L * atm/mol * K
        - T = the absolute temperature of the gas (K)
    - $\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$
    - If the volume is constant: As pressure increases, temperature increases; as temperature increases, pressure increases.
    - **Boyle's Law**
        - As pressure increases, volume decreases; as volume increases, pressure decreases.
    - **Charles's Law**
        - If the pressure is constant: As temperature increases, volume increases; as volume increases, temperature increases.
    - **Dalton's Law**
        - $P_{total} = P_a + P_b + P_c + ....$
    - **Partial Pressure**
        - $P_a = (P_{total})(X_a)$
        - $X_a = \frac{\text{moles of gas A}}{\text{total moles of gas}}$
- **Deviations from Ideal Behavior**
    - At low temperature and/or high pressure, gases behave in a less-than-ideal manner.
    - Two things happen when gas molecules are packed too tightly
        - The volume of the gas molecules becomes significant
        - Gas molecules attract one another and stick together
- **Density of a Gas**
    - $D = m/v$
