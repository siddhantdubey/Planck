- Every half-reaction has a reduction potential associated with.
- Flip the sign on this potential to get the oxidation potential.
- E0 = E0Cathode - E0Anode

- **Galvanic Cells**
    - In a galvanic cell, a favored redox reaction is used to generate a flow of current.
    - In a galvanic cell, the two half reactions take place in separate chambers, and the electrons that are released by the oxidation reaction pass through a wire to the chamber where they are consumed in the reduction reaction.
    - Oxidation takes place at the electrode called the anode.
    - Reduction takes place at the electrode called the cathode.
    - The salt bridge maintains the electrical neutrality in the cell. At the cathode, where reduction occurs and the solution is becoming less positively charged, the positive cations from the salt bridge solution flow into the half-cell. At the anode, where oxidation occurs and the solution becoming more positively charged, the negative anions from the salt bridge solution flow into the half-cell.
- **Electrolytic Cells**
    - In an electrolytic cell, an outside source of voltage is used to force an unfavored redox reaction to take place.
    - To determine which substance is reduced, you must compare the reduction potential of the cation with that of water. The half-reaction with the more positive value is the one that will occur.
- **Electroplating**
    - Electrolytic cells are used for electroplating.
    - There are four steps for figuring out electrolysis problems
        - If you know the current and the time, you can calculate the charge in coulombs
            - I = q/t
        - Once you know the charge in coulombs, you know how many electrons were involved in the reaction.
            - Moles of electrons = coulombs/(96500 coulombs/mol)
        - When you know the number of moles of electrons and you know the half-reaction for the metal, you can find out how many moles of metal plated out.
        - Once you know the number of moles of metal you can use what you know from stoichiometry to calculate the number of grams of metal.
    - For instance, if a current of 2.50 A is run through a solution of iron chloride for 15 minutes, it would cause the following mass of iron to plate out:
        - 15 minutes x 60 seconds/1minute x 2.50 C/1.0 second x 1 mol e/96500 C x 1 mol Fe/3 mole e- x 55.85 g/1 mol Fe = 0.434 g Fe
