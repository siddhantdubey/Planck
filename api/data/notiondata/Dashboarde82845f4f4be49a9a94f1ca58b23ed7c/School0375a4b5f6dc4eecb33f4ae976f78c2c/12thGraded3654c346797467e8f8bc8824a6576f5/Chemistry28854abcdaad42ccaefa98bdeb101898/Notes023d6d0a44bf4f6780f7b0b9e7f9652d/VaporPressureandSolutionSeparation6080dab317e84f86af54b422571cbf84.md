# Vapor Pressure and Solution Separation

Revised: No
Tags: Unit 3

# Vapor Pressure

- Vapor pressure arises from the fact that the molecules inside a liquid are in constant motion.
- If these molecules hit the surface of the liquid with enough kinetic energy, they can escape the intermolecular forces holding them to the other molecules and transition into the gas phase.
- This process is called vaporization. No outside energy is added.
- The strong the intermolecular forces, the lower the vapor pressure for the liquid

# Solution Separation

You can use intermolecular forces and the various Coulombic attractions that occur between ions and polar molecules in order to help separate various substances out from each other. There are several ways to do this.

- **Solutes and Solvents**
    - Like dissolves like
- **Paper Chromatography**
    - **Chromatography is the separation of a mixture by passing it in solution through a medium in which the components of the solution move at different rates.**
    - Paper chromatography is when paper is the medium through which the solution passes.
    - A piece of filter paper is suspended above a solvent so that the very bottom of the paper is touching the solvent.
    - The ink in question is usually black and dotted onto a line at the bottom of the filter paper that starts out just above the solvent level.
    - As the solvent climbs the paper, the various substances inside the ink will be attracted to the polar water molecules. The more polar the substance is, the more it will be attracted to the water molecules, and the further it will travel.
    - The substance (color) that travels the furthest will be the most polar.
    - The retardation factor (retention) is calculated like so:
        - $R_f = \frac{\text{Distance traveled by solute}}{\text{Distance traveled by solvent front}}$
    - The stronger the attraction, the larger the Rf value
    - Reverse the above if a non-polar solvent is used
- **Column Chromatography**
    - In this process, a column is packed with a stationary substance. Then, the solution to be separate is injected into the column (analyte), then another solution (eluent) is injected into the column.
    - As the eluent passes through the stationary phase, the analyte molecules will be attracted to it with varying degrees of strength depending on their polarity.
    - The more attracted certain analyte molecules are to the eluent, the faster they will travel through ("elute") and leave the column.
    - If there is a sufficient polarity difference between the components, they will leave the column at different times, allowing them to be separated.
    - Generally, after collecting the eluted mixture, it can be analyzed for compositional analysis via a variety of methods.
    - Either liquids or gases can be used as the eluent
- **Distillation**
    - Distillation takes advantage of the different boiling points of substances in order to separate them. For instance, if you have a mixture of water and ehtanol and then heat that mixture past ethanol's boiling point which is less than water's, the ethanol will boil but the water will not
    - A condenser is a piece of glassware that consists of a smaller tube running through a larger tube.
    - The larger tube has hose connections on it, allowing for water to be run through it.
    - This effectively cools the inner tube and not the outer tube.
    - At that point, the ethanol vapor, when run through the inner tube, will cool and condense back into a liquid form, which can be collected on the other side of the condenser.
    - It cannot be used to separate a mixture that contains substances with unknown boiling points
