- **Electron Configuration**
    - First find the number of electrons in the element.
    - Then, use the following chart to determine how many electrons get into each orbital.

    - Remember that you can write electron configurations in shorthand by replacing parts of them with the symbol for the noble gas at the end of the highest energy level that has been filled.
    
- **Aufbau Principle**
    - When building up the electron configuration of an atom, electrons are place in orbitals, subshells, and shells in order of increasing energy.
- **The Pauli Exclusion Principle**
    - The Pauli Exclusion Principle states that the two electrons which share an orbital cannot have the same spin. One electron must spin clockwise and the other must spin counterclockwise.
- **Hund's Rule**
    - When an electron is added to a subshell, it will always occupy an empty orbital if one is available. Electrons always occupy orbitals singly if possible and pair up only if no empty orbitals are available.
