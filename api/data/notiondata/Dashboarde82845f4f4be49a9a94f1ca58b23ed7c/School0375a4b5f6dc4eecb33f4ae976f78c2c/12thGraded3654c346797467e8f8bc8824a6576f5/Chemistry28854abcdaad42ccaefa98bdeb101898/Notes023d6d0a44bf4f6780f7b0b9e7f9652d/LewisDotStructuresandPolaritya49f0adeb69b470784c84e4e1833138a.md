# How to Draw a Lewis Dot Structure

1. Count the valence electrons in the molecule or polyatomic ion
2. If a polyatomic ion has a negative charge, add electrons equal to the charge of the total in (1). If a polyatomic ion has a positive charge, subtract electrons equal to the charge of the electrons from the total in (1).
3. Draw the skeletal structure of the molecule and place two electrons (or a single bond) between each pair of bonded atoms. If the molecule contains three or more atoms, the least electronegative atom will usually occupy the central position.
4. Add electrons to the surrounding atoms until each has a complete outer shell.
5. Add the remaining electrons to the central atom.
6. Look at the central atom.
    1. If the central atom has fewer than eight electrons, remove an electron pair from an outer atom and add another bond between that outer atom and the central atom. Do this until the central atom has a complete octet.
    2. If the central atom has a complete octet, you are finished.
    3. If the central atom has more than eight electrons, that's okay too, as long as the total does not exceed twelve.

# Molecular Geometry

- **Important Things To Remember**
    - Double and triple bonds are treated in the same way as single bonds in terms of predicting overall geometry for a molecule; however, multiple bonds have slightly more repulsive strength and will therefore occupy a little more space than single bonds
    - Lone electron pairs have a little more repulsive strength than bonding pairs, so molecules with lone pairs will have slightly reduced bond angles between terminal atoms.
- If the central atom has 2 electron pairs, then it has sp hybridization and its basic shape is **linear.**
- If the central atom has 3 electron pairs, then it has sp2 hybridization and its basic shape is trigonal planar; its bond angles are about 120 degrees.
- If the central atom has 4 electron pairs, then it has sp3 hybridization and its basic shape is tetrahedral; its bond angles are about 109.5 degrees.
- If the central atom has 5 electron pairs, its basic shape is trigonal bypyramidal.
- If the central atom has 6 electron pairs, its basic shape is octahedral.

# Polarity

- **What is a polar covalent bond?**
    - A covalent bond in which electrons are unequally shared.
- The unequal sharing of electrons causes something called dipoles. A dipole is an area of either negative or positive charge and it is based on the likelihood that electrons from a bond will be found around an atom.
- **A nonpolar covalent bond is in which no dipoles are present.**
- **Molecular Polarity**
    
    (General rule of thumb) If the molecule is made up of different atoms and there are any lone pairs on the central atom, the resulting molecule is asymmetrical and will be polar. If there are no lone pairs on the central atom, the molecule is symmetrical and the resulting molecule will be nonpolar.
