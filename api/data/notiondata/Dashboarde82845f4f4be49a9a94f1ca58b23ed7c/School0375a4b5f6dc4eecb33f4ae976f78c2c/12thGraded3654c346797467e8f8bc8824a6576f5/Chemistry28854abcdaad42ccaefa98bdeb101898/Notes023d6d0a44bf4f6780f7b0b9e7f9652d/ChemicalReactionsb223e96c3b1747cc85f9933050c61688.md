- **Types of Reactions**
    - Synthesis Reactions: When elements or simple compounds are combined to form a single more complex compound.
    - Decomposition: The opposite of a synthesis. A reaction where a single compound is split into two or  more elements or simple compounds.
    - Acid-Base Reaction: A reaction when an acid (i.e., H+) reacts with a base to form water and a salt.
    - Oxidation-Reduction: A reaction that results in the change of the oxidation states of some participating species
    - Hydrocarbon Combustion: When a covalent substance containing carbon and hydrogen is ignited, it reacts with the oxygen in the atmosphere. The products of a hydrocarbon combustion are always CO2 and H2O.
    - Precipitation: When two aqueous solutions mix, sometimes a new cation/anion pairing can create an insoluble salt. This type of reaction is called a precipitation reaction. Ions that do not participate in the reaction (not present in the net ionic equation) are called **spectator ions.**
- **Solubility Rules**
    1. Compounds with an alkali metal cation (Na+, Li+, K+, etc.) or an ammonium cation are always soluble.
    2. Compounds with a nitrate anion are always soluble.
- **Chemical Equations and Calculations**
    1. Convert whatever quantity you are given into moles
    2. If you are given information about two reactants, you may have to use the equation coefficients to determine which one is the limiting reagent. Remember, the limiting reagent is not necessarily the reactant that you have the least of; it is the reactant that runs out first.
    3. Use the balanced equation to determine how many moles of the desired product are generated. Convert moles of product to the desired unit.
    - Example:
        - $2HBr (aq) + Zn(s) -\rangle ZnBr_2(aq) + H_2(g)$
        - A piece of solid zinc weighing 98 grams was added to a solution containing 324 grams of HBr. What is the volume of H2 produced at standard temperature and pressure if the reaction above runs to completion?
            - Moles of Zn = 1.5 mol
            - Moles of HBr = 4.0 mol
            - Zn is the limiting reagent.
            - 1.5 moles of H2 produced because 1.5 moles of Zn consumed
            - Volume of H2 = (moles)(22.4 L/mol) = 33.6 L
- **Combustion Analysis**
    - A Compound containing hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen is combusted. 44.0 g of CO2 and 27.0 g of H2O are produced. Which of the following is a possible empirical formula for that compound?
        - 1 mole of CO2 = 44 g of CO2 so that means 1 mole of C in the original compound
        - 27.0 g of H2O means 1.5 moles of H2O were created. Because there are two hydrogen atoms in every H2O, that means there were 3.0 moles of hydrogen in the water which was created and thus 3.00 moles of H in the original compound. The C:H ration in the original compound must be 1:3.
        - So C2H6O works.
