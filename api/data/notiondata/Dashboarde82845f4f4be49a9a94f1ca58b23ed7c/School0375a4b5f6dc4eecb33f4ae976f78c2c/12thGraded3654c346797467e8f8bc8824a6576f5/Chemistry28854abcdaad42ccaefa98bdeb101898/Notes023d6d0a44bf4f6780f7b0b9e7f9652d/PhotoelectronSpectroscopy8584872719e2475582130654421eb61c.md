- **What is ionization energy?**
    - The amount of energy necessary to eject an electron of an atom.
- If the amount of ionization energy for all electrons ejected from a nucleus is charted, you get what is called a **photoelectron spectra** (PES) that looks like the following.

- The y axis of a photoelectron spectrum represents the relative number of electrons that are ejected from a given energy level and the x-axis shows the binding energy of those electrons. Ionization energy **decreases** going from left to right in a PES. The PES above is one for Neon.
- The peak at ~ 40 MJ binding energy corresponds to the 1s orbital. Since there are peaks at lower binding energy, it is implied that this orbital is filled (by 2 electrons). There are two peaks at lower binding energy corresponding to the 2s and 2p orbitals, respectively. The 2s peak has the same intensity as the 1s peak indicating it has the same number of electrons (2). The 2p peak is 3/2 as tall as the 2s peak and indicates that indicates it has 3 electrons in the orbital. The electron configuration of 1s2 2s2 2p3 makes the element N.
- Each section of peaks represents a different energy level.
