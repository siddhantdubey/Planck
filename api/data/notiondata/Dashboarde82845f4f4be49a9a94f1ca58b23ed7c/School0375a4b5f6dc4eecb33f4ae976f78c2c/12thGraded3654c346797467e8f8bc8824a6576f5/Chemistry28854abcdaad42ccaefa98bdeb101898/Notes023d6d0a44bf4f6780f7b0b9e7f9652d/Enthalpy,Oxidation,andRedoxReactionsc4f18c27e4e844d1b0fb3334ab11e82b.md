# Enthalpy, Oxidation, and Redox Reactions

Revised: No
Tags: Unit 4

- When bonds are formed, energy is released
- When bonds are broken, energy is absorbed
- Delta H = H_products - H_reactants
- Exothermic = negative enthalpy change
- Endothermic = positive enthalpy change

- **Oxidation States**
    - In many chemical reactions, electrons are transferred between the reactants. In order to determine which reactants are gaining electrons and which are losing electrons, we use something called an oxidation state. There are several rules when it comes to assigning oxidation states
    1. Any neutral atom that is not bonded to atoms of any other element has an oxidation state of zero. Examples: In Cu(s), the oxidation state on copper is zero. In O2(g), the oxidation on both atoms is zero.
    2. Any ions has an oxidation state equal to the charge on that ion. This includes ions bonded to other ions in any kind of ionic compound. 
    3. In most compounds, oxygen is -2. An exception worth knowing is that in hydrogen peroxide is -1.
    4. When bonded to a nonmetal, hydrogen is +1. When bonded to a metal, hydrogen is -1, Examples: In CH4, hydrogen is +1. 
    5. In the absence of oxygen, the most electronegative element in a compound will take on an oxidation state equal to its most common charge.
    6. The combined oxidation states on all elements in a neutral compound must add up to zero. 
- **Redox Reactions**
    - You lose electrons in oxidation
    - You gain electrons in reduction
    - Fe + 2HCl → FeCl2 + H2
    - The oxidation state of Fe changes from 0 to +2. (Reduced)
    - The oxidation state of H changes from +1 to 0. (Oxidized)
    - A redox reaction can be written as two half-reactions: one for the reduction and one for the oxidation.
    - The above can be written as follows
        - Fe → Fe2+ + 2e-
        - 2H+ + 2e- → H2
