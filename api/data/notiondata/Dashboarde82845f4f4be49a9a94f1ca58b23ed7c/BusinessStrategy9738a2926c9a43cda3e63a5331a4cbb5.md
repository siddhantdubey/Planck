# Main Ways of Making Money

## YouTube

- AdSense
    - To get this set up and running, I just need to upload better videos more consistently.
- Sponsorships
    - Get sponsorships, these will be emailed to me as I grow I believe. More research needs to be done.

## TikTok

- TikTok Creator Program
    - I am currently eligible for it, but I want to gain more of a following before I monetize it this way.
- Sponsorships
    - Get sponsorships, I do get messaged about them sometimes on TikTok.

## Blog

- Google AdSense
    - Write articles, post them and make some money off of ads by driving content from YouTube + TikTok.
- Sponsorships
    - I think people pay for some sponsored blog posts, but I'm not particularly sure about this.
