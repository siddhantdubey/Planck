Here's how I would learn to code if I had to start from scratch.

First, I'd pick a language to start with. I suggest either Python, Java, or Javascript if you plan on doing web development.

The benefit of doing Java first is you start with a "harder" language, and have the benefit of working with a typed language which instills good principles, you can learn Java from Programming with Mosh on YouTube. The benefit of starting with Python or Web Development is that they're "easier" and you'll see your progress a lot quicker, making it easier to keep going.

To learn Python, check out Sentdex on YouTube. If you're more into web development, check out theodinproject or freecodecamp. 

While you're learning any one of these languages, I would look at the project-based-learning github repository and build some of the projects mentioned here. 
If you're learning web development, also consider building a personal portfolio site. 

As I'm learning to code, I would try to build a little bit of all the ideas that come to me. The best way to learn is to build the ideas that you're interested in!

Once I have some experience with the language, I'd learn frameworks for that particular language. 
If I was learning Java, I'd learn JavaFX to build some desktop apps. If I was learning Python, I'd learn Django or Flask to build web apps or Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas for data science. If I was learning Web Development, I'd learn ReactJS and Node to build out some great web apps.

After that, I'd just keep building projects I think of and continually learning new things.
