Here are two simple tips for you if you're a beginner programmer or learning anything new.

One: Pick a clear goal. Do you want to build the backend of apps, make good looking frontends, or do data science/machine learning? Picking a specific and clear goal will help you stay motivated in whatever you're doing.

Two: Don't try to learn everything. Learn slowly and steadily, learn only a few things, but learn them well.
