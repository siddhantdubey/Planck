Hey I'm Sid and I like making cool things.

I spend a lot of time wrangling with code and building fun projects. 

- Clip 1: Me writing code (filmed)
- Clip 2: A little bit of me scrolling through github (filmed)

I also spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to be "productive" and make good YouTube videos for people to learn from and enjoy.
