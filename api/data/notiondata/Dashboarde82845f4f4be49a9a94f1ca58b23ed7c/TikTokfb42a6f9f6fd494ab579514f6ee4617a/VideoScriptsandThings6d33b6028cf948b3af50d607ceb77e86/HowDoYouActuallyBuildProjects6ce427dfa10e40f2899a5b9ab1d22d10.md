How do you build projects as a programmer?! You've probably heard plenty of people, including myself, yell at you to go ahead and build projects to get better at code. But how do you even start?

Sure it is easy to think to yourself that you're going to go ahead and build a project, but picking an idea and making sure that the project won't take too much time is its own demon that you need to conquer.

There's a few ways that you can ease yourself into building some projects to get experience. You can either 

1. Follow a tutorial from the internet or YouTube and then modify the code from that tutorial until you have something that is very different. 
2. Get an idea for a project from a resource like build-your-own-x or project-based-learning on GitHub.
3. Start building something that you had an idea for or that might help you in your day to day life. This could be something like a calculator for a specific class or something that automates your daily tasks. For info about that, check out automatetheboringstuffwithpython.
