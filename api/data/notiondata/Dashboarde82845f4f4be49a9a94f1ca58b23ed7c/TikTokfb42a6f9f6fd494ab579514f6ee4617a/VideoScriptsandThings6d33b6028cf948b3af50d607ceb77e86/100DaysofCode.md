# Script

Hey! I'm Sid and I'm starting off on a journey of a 100 days of code!

Every day for a hundred days I'll work on a large project, or build out a small mini-project. Being consistent for a good period of time will let me get much better at coding and I should end up with a lot of cool projects to show off.

Today is day 1 and I'm going to spend some time coding up a script that will make music based on the Recaman Sequence, a really cool sequence of numbers. If you want to join me on this journey, then hit that plus button and follow along if you like coding, math, or physics.
