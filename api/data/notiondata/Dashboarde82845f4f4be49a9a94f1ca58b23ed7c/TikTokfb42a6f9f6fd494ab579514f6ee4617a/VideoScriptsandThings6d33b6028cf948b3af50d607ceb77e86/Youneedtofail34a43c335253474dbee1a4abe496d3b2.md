# You need to fail.

You NEED to fail and struggle. There isn't any way to learn how to code or anything for that matter besides that. Now I'm not saying struggle and cause your mental health harm, I'm saying struggle with problems and don't give up. Failing and then googling solutions to your struggles is a sign of progress. Struggle with a problem for a few hours before giving up and asking someone for help. What you learn through struggle will stick with you forever, and that's awesome. Sorry for being so dramatic, but if you want more, follow!
