# Recaman Sequence

The beautiful pattern you see on the screen is a visualization of the recaman sequence.

The sequence is pretty simple. First off, it starts at 0. Every term after that is decided by a simple rule. The nth term will be equal to the n-1th term - n if the n-1th term - n is greater than 0 AND not already in the sequence. Otherwise it will equal the n-1th term + n. You end up getting this visualization by drawing semicircles from 1 term to the next. What you're seeing is a number line, with the top semicircles coming from moving forward on the number line, and the bottom semicircles coming from moving backwards on the number line. The first terms of the recaman sequence are 0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 21, 11, and 22. It is assumed that every non-negative integer fits in this sequence, but no formal proof has been written.
