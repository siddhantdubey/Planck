# Double Pendulum

status: posted

This is a double pendulum. It's a classic example of a chaotic dynamic system. 

A problem you would see in a Physics class would be to find the equations of motion for this pendulum, which is easy to do when you use Lagrangians.

The double pendulum is a great model of chaotic motion, and the motion it undergoes is heavily reliant on the initial conditions like the angle between the first limb and the y-axis and the second limb and the y-axis. Changing those two angles allows for beautiful patterns to emerge. 

Chaos really is beautiful.
