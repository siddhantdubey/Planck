# Tips for Time Management TikTok

status: posted

Here's three really simple tips so you can manage your time better during the school year.

1. Use a To-Do list. It may seem simple, but having a to-do list that is in front of you at all times is great for maintaining focus. Plus, checking things off feels GREAT!
2. Set clear working hours. Set aside blocks of your day where you will be working and nothing else can distract you. You can use chrome extensions like limit to block distracting sites to help.
3. Prioritize your tasks. Not every assignment deserves your full effort, some are just less important than others and it is OK to do the bare minimum for an A on those assignments.
