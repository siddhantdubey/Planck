- PokeAPI: the api has a bunch of data about different pokemon that you can use to build random web apps, like a pokedex or something.
- Kanye Rest API: The API just sends you back a random kanye quote, you could make a pretty good looking website out of this.
- Clarifai API: It allows for out of the box computer vision and you could make some really cool things out of this.
