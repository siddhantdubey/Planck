Here are two tools that are really making it easy for me to organize my life in College.

First of all, we have Notion which I use to keep track of my homework, assignments, and essays for the entire semester. I also use it to write YouTube scripts and documentation for some of my code projects. Basically everything.

Second of all, we have Obsidian which is what I use for my daily to-do lists and taking notes on books and articles and such. Both of these combined make it really easy for me to be productive.

I have a whole video talking about how I use them together on my YouTube channel, link in bio.
