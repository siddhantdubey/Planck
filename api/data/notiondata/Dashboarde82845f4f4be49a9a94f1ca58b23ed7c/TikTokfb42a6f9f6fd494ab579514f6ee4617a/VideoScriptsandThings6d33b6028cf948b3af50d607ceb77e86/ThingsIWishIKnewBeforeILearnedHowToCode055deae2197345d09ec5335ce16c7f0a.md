Here are three things I wish I knew before I learned how to code.

1. The number one thing I wish I knew is that coding isn't something you take one course on and know. It isn't precalculus, it's something that you'll have to be continually learning and improving on as you go on.
2. Coding isn't always a solo thing. Of course a lot of the time you'll be writing code yourself, but that code will have to fit with code other people are writing and it's important to learn how to code with other people and how to use Git and GitHub.
3. Imposter syndrome is pretty unavoidable, but it kinda helps to know that even the most experience programmers google all the time. Programming is basically just advanced googling. You'll probably get imposter syndrome, but it helps to know that 99% of people who code have experienced that at some point.
