# How I Would Learn Data Science If I Had To Start From Scratch

- Learn Python
    - Sentdex on YouTube has tutorials for all you need to know
    - Learn the basics of the language
    - And the following 3 libraries: Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas
- I'd also at this point be learning the math you would need.
- If nothing else, you should at least attempt to learn statistics and probability which you can do through seeing-theory by Brown University.
- Also learn the math behind regressions, certain classification algorithms like decision trees and random forests, and clustering.
- You can learn all of that from really any tutorial on YouTube that is highly ranked. Make sure to take plenty of notes.
- If you plan on proceeding into deep learning at some point, then I would suggest learning Linear Algebra from Gilbert Strang and also learning Calculus and Multivariable Calculus, which you can do through khan academy.
- Then find some dataset that seems interesting. You can do this on Kaggle. Once you've done that, play around with the dataset. Think about what questions you might want to answer, what variables might have correlations, and try to make models and visualizations to back up your hypotheses.
- Of course, you can also follow one of the many Kaggle mini-courses to get your hands dirty in terms of playing with datasets.
- Keep following tutorials and building projects but after 2-3 tutorials, stop and do something completely by yourself. Of course you can google things, but don't follow a tutorial word for word.
- Then you keep exploring new projects and building your portfolio and skills.
- Once you feel comfortable with the basics, you can proceed to more advanced fields, like Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
- Hope that helped!
