- Here's how I organize my day with Obsidian and daily notes
- It isn't anything crazy, but it does help me stay focused throughout the day.
- So here's what my daily notes page looks like.
- We have a few things to take a look at:
    - I have these 4 habit tracker things at the top, my mood, productivity, sleep, and reading.
    - I fill out mood and sleep as soon as I wake up, writing down what my mood was like when I woke up and the time that I woke up.
    - At the end of the day, I'll write down how productive I felt I was, and how long I read for the day.
- The next section I have consists of my planned highlight for the day, or in other words, it is the ONE thing I HAVE TO get done. Today, it was getting to work on my new coding project, a spotify music taste analyzer.
- Then I write down one thing I am grateful for, every day this thing will be family.
- Then, I write down my To-Dos and periodically check back on these throughout the day.
- Then I have a morning brain dump section, where I write down the thoughts that are crossing my mind in the morning, a daily notes section, where I write down anything memorable that happened, and a nightly reflection, where I write down how I felt about the day. To be completely honest, I rarely ever use the sections.
- If you guys enjoyed this video and want a deeper dive into my productivity system, I have a longer video up on my YouTube channel link in bio. I hope this helped!
