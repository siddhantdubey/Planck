# Donut Shaped C Code

tags: entertainment, explainer, tech

On the top of your screen you should see a 3d spinning donut, or more accurately torus, and on the bottom of your screen you see the donut shaped code that produces it written by Andy Sloane, and you should definitely check out his blog post (link in comments) and show him love.

What it does is easy to understand but hard to implement. You make a circle, then rotate the circle around the y axis to make the donut then spin the donut around the x and z axes and project it onto the 2d screen. Then you use different ascii characters to create a sort of lighting effect, and boom you have a 3d spinning donut made by donut shaped code.
