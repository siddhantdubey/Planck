## How do I come up with Ideas that make it easy to do the above?

- Making cool AI projects
- Using reinforcement learning to play some popular games
- Explaining computer science concepts
- Vlogs
- Productivity/Motivation content that is *aesthetic*
- Showing off my projects, AI and otherwise
- Teaching people how to be productive
- Showing people how to do things that would benefit them
- Telling stories: How I got into X, How I got an internship at Y company, The Time I won X award, etc.
