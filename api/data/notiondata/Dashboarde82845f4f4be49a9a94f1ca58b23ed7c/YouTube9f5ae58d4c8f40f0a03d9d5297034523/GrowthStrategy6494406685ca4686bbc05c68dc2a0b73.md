# Growth Strategy

## How do I Grow on YouTube?

- Make YouTube videos consistently
- Have amazing thumbnails and titles to get people to click
- Be interesting when I'm talking so that people will stay in the video
- Have an early call to action 1 minute in asking people to subscribe and one at the end of the video asking people to subscribe.
- Try to get people to come over to YouTube through my TikTok account.
- Post on relevant subreddits to get people to see my YouTube videos.

## How do I come up with Ideas that make it easy to do the above?

- Find what other people on the internet are talking about by scrolling around on TikTok
- Making timeless or relevant tutorial videos. Eg, building a web app that does X topical thing, data analysis on some cool dataset
- Literally just make cool shit
- Vlogs when I get on Campus
- High value search terms: How I got an internship at X, How I got into Georgia Tech, etc.
