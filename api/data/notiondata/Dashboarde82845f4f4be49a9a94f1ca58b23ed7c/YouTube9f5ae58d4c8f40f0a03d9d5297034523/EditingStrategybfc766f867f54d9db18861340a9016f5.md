# Editing Strategy

# Main Points To Increase User Retention:

- Cut a lot, when there are lulls in sentences, cut them out. When you think you've cut enough, cut a little more.
- Lots of dynamic zooms, ease in and out, linear, and just do zoom cuts.
- Bring up images and text whenever you can, the more the user has to look at the screen the better.
- Infuse as much energy as possible into these videos
