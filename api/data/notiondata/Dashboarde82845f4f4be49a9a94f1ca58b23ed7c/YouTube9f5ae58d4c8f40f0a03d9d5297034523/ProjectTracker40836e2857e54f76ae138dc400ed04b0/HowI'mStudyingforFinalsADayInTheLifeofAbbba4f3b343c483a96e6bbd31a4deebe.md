- [x]  Then show a few shots of me being in astrophysics while working on my astro project and digihum project
    - [x]  One angle from my left angled at the screen
    - [x]  And one angle from my right angled at the screen
- [x]  Some brief clips of me leaving the study room and a brief clip of me eating lunch
- [x]  Some Clips of Me Watching YouTube and Playing Trackmania
- [x]  After lunch, I'll briefly describe my schedule for finals week and how I'm preparing for finals

# Voiceover Script

I'd just finished my Complex Systems class and had a little bit of time in between it and my next class of the day, so I got to work on my Digital Humanities final paper, one on of 5 finals I have to work on. I'm working on trying to map the network of YouTube channels that make political content and I end up making some pretty cool visualizations.

After I'm done with that, I head off to my second class of the day Astrophysics at 10:20 AM. Since it's finals week, I spend this class block working on my astrophysics final paper where my task is to derive Kepler's Laws using the Euler-Lagrange equation. I'd already done a lot of work for this last week, so I finish it up pretty quickly and get back to working on my Digital Humanities project. I continue to make some more visualizations of the network and write down my analysis to fill up some space on the paper. I end up getting really close to finishing it and then class ends and it is time for me to go grab some lunch.

For lunch today, I ate a delicious meal of black eyed peas, rice, yogurt and some boiled eggs. After a good and filling meal, I head back upstairs. I'm feeling a bit lethargic so instead of hopping straight back into work, I decide to take advantage of the two hour break until my next class and just watch some YouTube and play trackmania for half an hour. After I beat my personal best on a few tracks, I get back to work on my Digital Humanities project. I work for a while, put the finishing touches on the project and begin to feel really good about myself, because at this point I've finished 3 out of 5 of my finals. Then I realize I still have to study for AP Chem next week and feel sad again. 

At 2:15 I join the zoom for my Topics in Theoretical Math class and we talk about some applications of the number theory and group theory concepts that we learned throughout the semester. Both of those are really interesting fields of mathematics and if you ever get the chance to take a class in either of them, I would recommend you do so! Once class is over, I don't really feel like doing any work since I only have 40 minutes till I have to tutor, so I hop in discord and watch my friends play a game of valorant since I don't have the time to play a complete game myself. I tell them how bad they are and then hop off discord and get on to zoom for a meeting where I discuss a project I worked on during the school year.

The meeting goes well and I put the finishing touches on the project so it can be passed on to students next year and I then prepare for my tutoring session at 5 PM. I hop on to zoom at 5 and get ready to teach. 

Today, my student and I went over javascript as they continued to work on a project I had assigned them to make. Essentially, they're working on making a nice calculator for various geometric formulae, and today they wrote up the actual javascript functions to do the calculations! If you have any interest in learning web development then I suggest you get started as soon as possible, because it is super fun. I finish tutoring for the day and head down to get some dinner. 

After a great meal of pakodas and some more lobiya and rice, I head back upstairs. Given that the AP Chemistry exam is in a few weeks and my final for AP Chem is next week, I pull out my AP Chem textbook and open up Notion to take some notes. If you want to know how I organize my life with Notion and Obsidian which is what I use for my daily notes you've seen in this video, I'll leave a link in the description. I study for an hour, not a long time but I do manage to get some high value studying in.

At this point, I was tired out and didn't really want to do anything else "productive", so I open up Valorant hop in a discord call and play for a few hours with my friends. We win some, we lose some, but it's a fun time and I enjoyed it a lot. I get off after our last game of the night in which we got completely rolled. 

At 11 PM, I turn off the lights, leave my desk, and head to sleep.

Well, that was a day in my life, I hope you enjoyed and if you did consider subscribing, leaving a like, joining my discord server, and following me on my social accounts all of which are linked in the description down below. Thanks for watching, and I hope you have a great day.
