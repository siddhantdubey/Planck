## Intro

Hey everybody and welcome back to another video! My name is Sid and today I'll be teaching you guys how to speak programmer, and more specifically a quick little primer about Discrete Math. Now I won't be teaching you everything about Discrete Math at all, because it is typically a class that is at least a semester long to get the basics completely under your belt. BUT what I will be doing is making it so that you know what Discrete Math is, most of the topics that it covers, and where you can learn more. 

If y'all get the video to 100 likes, I will make more in-depth videos for each of the topics covered in this video.

## What is Discrete Math?

Discrete math deals with the study of discrete objects. Very helpful, I know. Here's a better explanation. So first of all, Discrete math doesn't really refer to one specific type of math like say Calculus does. Discrete math refers to a lot of different branches of math including graph theory, set theory, and boolean logic and boolean algebra, and number theory.

All of these branches deal with objects that are distinct and have discrete values, and are not continuous like the functions you would see in calculus. An example of a discrete object is a triangle, a triangle has 3 edges and 3 vertices. A circle is continuous, it has an infinite number of points, but if you had to take care of all those infinite points, you wouldn't be able to write a program to do so! The code would run forever, so what we do instead is approximate it with a very large number of points such that the end result looks like a circle.

I hope that made sense. Anyways, discrete math is the basis for a lot of Computer Science, so it is important to know if you want to pursue a Computer Science degree, and less so if you just want to be developing things. It is still very helpful to know though!

## What Topics do you have to Know in Discrete Math?

In discrete math, you'll have to learn a few subjects. The most important of them in my opinion are the following:

- Logic and Proofs
- Number Theory
- Combinatorics and Discrete Probability
- Graph Theory
- Set Theory
- Relations and Recurrences

All of these are really important to get a good basis in discrete math, but the first things you would learn would be logic and proofs, set theory, relations and recurrences, and combinatorics and discrete probability. After that you would take graph theory and number theory and other topics. Now, let's talk a little about what each of these means and some good resources for learning them. If you have any suggestions for resources that I missed out, leave them in the comments and join my discord server and share it with the wonderful community of learners in there!

## Logic and Proofs, Set Theory, Relations and Recurrences

Logic is just the study of reasoning, but in the discrete math sense you'd be doing this formally within the language of logic which you'll learn as you take a course in  Logic or watch YouTube tutorials on it. 

Set Theory is the study of sets, which you can basically think of a collection of objects and the objects can be whatever you want to be honest, so like lists in Python. That's a very informal definition of them, but they are a fundamental discrete math structure and it is super important to know them.

In the process of studying these two fields, you'll develop an understanding of proofs as they'll show up in the discrete math book you use to study them!

Relations and recurrences will also show up in the youtube series I'll recommend. 

Alright, enough beating around the bush, here's the YouTube series I recommend. Dr. Trefor Bazett has an amazing long playlist of videos on Discrete Math that explain everything you need to know about the field as a Computer Science student, and I'll leave a link to it in the description. To find practice problems and such, I would recommend checking on MIT's OpenCourseware to find worksheets to solve.

## Combinatorics and Discrete Probability, Graph Theory, and Number Theory

All of these subjects are typically their own course and for good reason. They're all very expansive and the first course you take in these classes will only really be brief intros to the field themselves.

Combinatorics and Probability deals with counting but in a clever way in addition to just good old probability or figuring out the change of events occurring. Again, that is a very reduced down explanation of what the field is. If you want a great visual explanation of probability concepts, I would recommend checking out seeing theory by Brown University, I'll leave a link to the site in the description down below. Additionally, the youtube playlist I recommended above contains videos covering all the combinatorics and probability concepts you would need to know for basic discrete math.

Moving on to talking about Graph Theory. Graph Theory is the study of graphs. Once again, I'm very helpful. And no, it's not about studying bar graphs and line charts, the graphs that graph theory talks about are collections of nodes and the edges that connect these nodes. Graphs are used to represent a lot of cool different things, from road networks to social networks to information. Once again, the youtube playlist I mentioned earlier contains the basic information you need to know about graphs as a computer scientist.

Number theory is the study of integers, simple as that. To get a great grasp of number theory, check out Michael Penn's YouTube series on it, plus he has a bunch of other great videos on math topics that aren't number theory. That's besides the point though, his videos on number theory are great and you'll have an awesome time learning from them.
