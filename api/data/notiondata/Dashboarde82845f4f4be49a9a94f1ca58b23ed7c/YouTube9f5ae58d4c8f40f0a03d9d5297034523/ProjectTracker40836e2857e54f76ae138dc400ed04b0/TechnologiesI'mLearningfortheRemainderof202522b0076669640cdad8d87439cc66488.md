## Intro

Hey everyone, my name is Sid and I like making videos about programming, math, productivity, and a whole lot more. Today, we'll be talking about my tech goals for the remainder of 2021! I'll be talking about the technologies I'm learning and improving upon for the remainder of 2021. I don't really know what the point of this video is, maybe you'll get some inspiration about what you might want to learn next in your programming journey.

## The Technologies

Here are the technologies I'm going to *ATTEMPT* to learn and build a project with for the remainder of the year. Keep in mind, that I will definitely not get to all of these but I will try to do as many as I possibly can.

So here they are, I'll go into depth about each one shortly:

- React JS and maybe TailwindCSS
- AWS
- Flutter
- React Native
- Docker

These are the five technologies I want to get my feet wet in before 2021 ends, so I have about 5 months to take a look at these 5 technologies.

Alright, without further ado, let's get straight into talking about why I want to learn each one of these technologies.

## ReactJS and TailwindCSS

I don't think anybody really needs a crazy explanation for why they want to learn React JS. But, I'll give you mine.

So I've already been learning React a little bit throughout 2021 and have made a few small projects here and there, but I still don't feel like I know it well enough, so I'm going to focus a bit more on it in the coming months and build out some more small but complex projects.

The reason behind wanting to learning React, is that I've always kind of neglected the front-end side of things, and I've been wanting to go beyond just basic HTML/CSS/JS for a while now. Learning React will hopefully help me create better looking web apps and make me more confident in my abilities to build something from end to end. Also, I want to learn React because of this guy (*insert picture of Ben Awad*). 

In the process of improving my React skills if I find that I have some free time, I'll also try to pick up a little bit of TailwindCSS so that I have to spend less time fretting about CSS and I can spend more time just doing it. We'll see about this one though. I'll make a video in January of next year talking about everything I've learned.

## Amazon Web Services

I think the main reason behind me wanting to learn AWS and get the basic cloud practitioner certificate at the very least is simply to be more employable. I feel like AWS is a valuable skill to have in the job market and I want to pick it up mainly for that reason.

Another reason is that I always kind of feel lost when thinking about the "cloud" or whatever, and studying up on AWS will definitely help me wrap my head around it and will hopefully teach me about scalability. Who knows how this will go, I'll let you know if anything cool comes out of it!

## Flutter

So this one is kind of cheating since I already know Flutter, or I would like to think that I do already know it. However, I really don't have anything to show for it except a really poorly designed image classification app.  

To make up for that, I'll try to make a mediocre Flutter app as a side project by the end of the year. If you have any suggestions for some nice project ideas, leave them in the comments, because if there's one thing that's very hard for my brain to do, it's come up with ideas. 

Anyways, I don't know what the job market for Flutter looks like, all I know is that I enjoy working with it and it'll be fun to revisit and build a project in, especially with the fairly active updates that it gets.

## React Native

Why am I planning on learning React Native if I'm already learning Flutter? Is a question you may ask. The reason is pretty simple, I just want to learn React Native! I mean I'm already learning React so might as well take a crack at React Native and see how it compares to Flutter and which one I enjoy coding more in. Then I can make more informed decisions for side projects I take up in the future as to what cross platform mobile dev framework I want to use.

But why not Native dev Sid! Why not use Swift for iOS dev and Kotlin for Android dev. Simply put, I just don't want to.

## Docker

I'm learning Docker because it's a buzzword. Plus, I've run docker compose -up in my terminal enough times without knowing what it means so its time I take some time out of my not busy schedule and give Docker the respect it deserves by learning it. So, I'll learn Docker and ship an application as a docker container or whatever the heck they're called. There's a reason I need to learn it, I don't know what the heck I'm talking about!

## Outro/Conclusion

Well that's all I really have to say about the technologies I want to learn for the remainder of 2021.
