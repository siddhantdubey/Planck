# Talking Points

### Intro

- Introduce myself and channel
- briefly cover what a hackathon is
- talk about what hackathon i went to
- talk about what i knew before going to the hackathon

### Finding a Team

- I didn't have a team for this hackathon so I had to find one when I got there.
- I started the process the day of the hackathon in the hackathon slack, i asked around seeing if anyone needed another person in their team that knew python

### The Project

- We built a Django Web App where people could make requests for items that they needed
- like mittens, food, toiletries etc
- it wasn't the best idea and our implementation wasn't the greatest either
- BUT i went from not knowing django to figuring out and actually building something quickly which i found to be really awesome.

### What I Learned

- Django
- Working with other people on medium scale projects
- That biting off too many features for a project is never a good thing
- How to deal with adversity
- chatting with new people

### Should you Do Hackathons?

- The answer is yes
