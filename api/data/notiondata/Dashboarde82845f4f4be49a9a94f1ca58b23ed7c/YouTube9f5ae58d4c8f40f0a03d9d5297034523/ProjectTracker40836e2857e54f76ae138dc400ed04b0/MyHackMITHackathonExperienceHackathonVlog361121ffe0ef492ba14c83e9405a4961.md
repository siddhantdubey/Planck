Description:

Hey everybody! This is my first hackathon vlog of the year where I attend MIT's hackathon HackMIT virtually and build out a small web app by cobbling together a bunch of different APIs. I submitted my project to the education track at HackMIT and although I didn't win anything I learned a lot about developing web apps and using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technology in a production environment. Hackathons are a great learning experience and I'll be sure to attend more for the rest of the school year. The next one should be HackGT (Georgia Tech's hackathon) in October. Stay tuned for that!  For those curious, I used ReactJS + Flask to build the web app.
