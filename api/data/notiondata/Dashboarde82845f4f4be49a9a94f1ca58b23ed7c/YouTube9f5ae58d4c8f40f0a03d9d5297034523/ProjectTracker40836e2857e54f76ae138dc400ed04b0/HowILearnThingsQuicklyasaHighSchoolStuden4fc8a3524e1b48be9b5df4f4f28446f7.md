# Script

- I've been coding for a LONG TIME, I think the first time I wrote a line of code was in 3rd grade or so, and since then I've learned a lot of new things, whether that be new programming languages or libraries or concepts for school.
- Since then I've gotten to the point where I'm able to learn a new programming lnaguage in a few hours and grasp new concepts in school fairly quickly.
- Just as a quick disclaimer, everyone learns things at different speeds and you might learn some things that take others ages very quickly and vice versa, so don't stress too much about not learning quickly. These tips are just to help you improve your current skills.
- There's a few main ways that I've done this and I'll walk you through those in this video! My examples will be centered mostly around learning how to code but the tips apply even if you're cramming for an exam in school. So without further ado let's get right into it.

**Three Methods:**

- 80/20 Principle (Pareto Principle): Recognize that not everything you're learning is relevant the first time over. You might have heard of the Pareto Principle, that 80% of results come from only 20% of efforts. Of course these numbers aren't exact but the underlying principle is still very true. There's diminishing returns as you put more effort in and study more, you'll be doing more work to gain smaller bits of mastery of the subject, and this isn't something I like to do the first time around.
- When I start learning something new, I first like to scope out the subject, note down all the main parts of the subject and then get to work on learning these main parts and ignoring the tiny details for the time being. For instance, when I'm learning a new library or programming language, I'll learn the main concepts and syntax that I need to build a project and ignore the tiny details for a while. This allows me to be able to use the language a lot quicker and be more efficient with my time. Then, I fill in the gaps as I use the language over a longer period of time.
- You should do the same when you are learning something new, especially if you happen to be cramming for an exam. Hit all the main points of the subject, master that and then go into the tiny details if you want to.
- So as a quick reminder, DON'T try to learn everything about the topic first. Learn the main points and the meat of the subjecy first. It is a lot quicker and allows you to learn the minute details at a later time.

**Method 2, Taking Good Notes:**

- Once you've recognized that the 80/20 Principle is true, it is time for you to learn how to take good notes.
- Now there's a million ways to take good notes, and a bunch of YouTube videos telling you how to take good notes (some of which I'll link in the description), so I'll cover the highlights.
- One: It doesn't really matter if you take your notes on a laptop or pen and paper although taking notes on pen and paper is said to increase retention.
- Two: STOP just making bulleted lists of notes. Obviously this applies if you're coding because the best way to learn to code is to actually write code, and the best way to learn things like math and physics is to do math and physics problems. However for more literature based things, you need to stop taking bulleted lists of notes that are just copying things from a textbook, presentation, or video. This is very ineffective in my experience. Read the textbook or presentation, go through the video and then summarize the key concepts. Don't copy anything word for word. And instead of putting them in straight up bullet points, use the Cornell Notes Method, write down questions that relate to the content in the margins of your notes if you're using pen and paper, and then cover up the bullet points when you're reviewing your notes, because it'll make the content stick in your head. If you're using Notion, then use toggle lists, and make the main toggles questions and the items within the toggle be the notes and answers that relate to the question. This makes it easy to review your notes when you look back on them. And one of the most important bits is to write down a summary of the unit or chapter at the end of your notebooks.

**Method 3, The Feynman Technique:**

- I think this is the most important part of learning things quickly and being able to let them stick in my head.
- After you've watched videos about something or read a textbook and taken good notes, then you need to see if you can explain what you learned to someone else without referencing your notes. This is what is known as the *Feynman Technique* after the famed physicist Richard Feynman.
- You don't have to actually teach a real person, you could just explain it to yourself in a mirror or just explain it out loud to yourself, something I've done quite a bit. Or, you could try explaining it to some of your friends or family.
- Of course, not everything can be easily explained to everyone, so it's best to make sure you can explain it to yourself first, and then see if you can explain it concisely to someone else. If you really want to do something cool, then make YouTube videos about what you learn and see if they turn out good, who knows, you might even get to meet some cool people because of it?
