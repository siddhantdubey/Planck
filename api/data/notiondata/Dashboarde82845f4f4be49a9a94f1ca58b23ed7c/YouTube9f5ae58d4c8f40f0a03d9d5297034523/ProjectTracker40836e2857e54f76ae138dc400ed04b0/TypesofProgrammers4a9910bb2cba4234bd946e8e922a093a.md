## The Machine Learning Fan

- [x]  Yea, I just finished that Stanford Machine Learning course on Coursera, I'm getting one step closer to finishing my startup UnAIcorns, the stuffed animal recommendation system using AI.
- [x]  The fit this data with neural network clip
- [x]  Clip of me writing import keras in a jupyter notebook
- [x]  Yup, I did kind of skip the math portion of Machine Learning but that's just because Andrew Ng told me to not worry about if I don't understand it.
- [x]  get meme of Andrew Ng

## The Stack Overflower

- [x]  Is writing a list comprehension in python
- [x]  Googles "how to write list comprehension in python stack overflow"
- [x]  Copies and pastes the first result in to code

## The "Entrepreneur"

- [x]  Yea, my startup's going well. UnAIcorns is going to the moon.
- [x]  I think we'll be a multi-billion dollar company in a year, the market for stuffed animal blockchain AI recommendations is crazy.
- [x]  So what are you working on? You're studying for class? Go be your own boss dude, quit the rat race.
- [x]  Yea we're raising funds right now, nobody has *said* they want to invest in our company, but how could they *NOT* want to!

## The Genius

- [x]  I've been coding since the age of four, and won my first medal at the international Olympiad of informatics at the age of five.
- [x]  I got a 100 on that exam. Oh, you got an 80? I can help you study for next time.
- [x]  I got interviews from every FAANG in my junior year of high school.
- [x]  Hey, I know you gave me these tickets an hour ago, but I went ahead, coded them up, and also added some additional features I think the customer would like.

## The Caffeine Addict

- [x]  Just chugging caffeine, "I can't get anything done without coffee"
- [x]  Stays up until 4 AM working on projects
- [x]  I can quit anytime I want to, don't look at me like that!

## The "Purist"

- [x]  Python isn't a real programming language, it's a *scripting* language, humph!
- [x]  I use C++, like a *real* programmer. I don't associate with lowlife like you.
- [x]  This guy was trying to tell me he's a "programmer", when all he does is use HTML and CSS. What a wannabe.

## The Python Lover

- [x]  I built this calculator app in only 2 lines of code! All I had to do was import calculator from calculator, and I was done!
- [x]  Wait, you had to implement that from scratch? I had a library to do it for me. You should try Python.
- [x]  Did you know that I LOVE using Python? It was the first language I learned. What do you mean you can tell?
