## Intro

First off, I'm sorry if this video ends up seeming braggy. Also, I did pull an all-nighter like twice in high school, but the majority of my high school career was managed well enough so that I could get my work done pretty quickly and still have more than enough time to enjoy myself later. There really were only a few things that helped me do that, and I hope these same tips will help me get good sleep in college, which I start in like two weeks which is absolutely crazy.

Alright, enough with the self-promo, let's get straight into talking about managing your time in high school.

## A little bit of background:

Here's a little bit of background so you can understand where my tips are coming from, but if you wanna skip directly to me talking about the tips then you can find the timestamps for that in the description down below.

So I went to three different high schools. I went to one for 9th grade, one for 10th grade, and the last for 11th and 12th grade. My 9th grade and 10th grade courseloads were pretty light. My 9th grade school didn't let freshmen take APs, and my 10th grade school only allowed us to take two APs so I didn't have to do too much work in both of those grades, especially 9th, but I did have quite a bit of work to do in 10th grade but it was nothing compared to the amount of work that I would have to do in 11th and 12th grade.

The school I went to in 11th and 12th grade is a residential public high school in North Carolina called the North Carolina School of Science and Math. It's known for having heavy workloads and many alumni say that their time their was harder than the time they spent at their colleges academically. At NCSSM, I took hard classes and I participated in quite a few extracurriculars, but I always had time for good sleep and hanging out with my friends. People say that you can only pick two out of the three of sleep, fun, and good grades, but I'm 100% sure you can do all three. I usually went to sleep from 10:30 to 12, with a few times going to sleep at like 2 or 3 and once pulling an all nighter, but I managed to get 7-8 hours of sleep each night pretty regularly. Alright, enough background let's talk about how I actually managed to manage my time. 

## The Tips:

So here are the fourish things that helped me manage my time better, I'll explain each one in its own section. 

- Daily To-Do Lists (this sounds simple, but I'll explain it more)
- Setting clear working hours where I tried my best to not interact with others
- Clearly prioritizing your work
- Learning to say no!

They're not all distinct, in fact all of these things go hand in hand are hard to distinguish from each other. Alright, let's talk about each one of the "tips".

## Daily To-Do Lists

So the idea of to-do lists is seemingly a very simple thing, but it does wonders! Every day when I woke up, I would write down the things I had to do. I started off doing this in a physical notebook, like this one right here. I now do this on Obsidian which is a great note taking app, and I'll have a video about that coming out soon so sub if you wanna hear about it. 

Anyways, in addition to writing down my actual to-dos, I will write down my schedule for the day. And while I'm writing down my schedule, I'll slot in my to-dos somewhere in there. So if I had class from 8-10 AM and then no class until 11, I'd schedule in my first to-do from 10 - 11 AM. More on this later. 

I'd have this book with me at all times and open it regularly so that my responsibilities would stare me in the face and if I felt like slacking off, the looming to-do list would look at me and I'd get right to work.

## Setting Clear Working Hours

Hand in hand with writing down my schedule each day is setting clear working hours. This is pretty self explanatory, all it means is that you need to set clear parts of the day where you'll be working and it's non negotiable. You will do you work until your work is done during these times. It doesn't have to be a long continuous section of time, and in fact it probably shouldn't be. Do one and a half hours of work, or if you want to do a long five hour block then go for it. For me, this was a bit easier because of the residential campus. I didn't have school from 7-3 PM, I had classes in blocks and periods of break that I could use to do work. For you it might be harder, but try to get your homework done in class if possible, otherwise you're going to have spend more time at home.

Once you have an idea for how you want to block your time, maybe like 1.5 hours of work and then 15 minutes of YouTube, put it down in Google Calendar and stick to it everyday.

Obviously things will come up and ruin your schedule and it is possible you will have to stay up late every once in a while, but if you have a clear schedule and working hours, it is unlikely to happen.

## Clearly Prioritizing Your Work

The next thing that really helped me out was prioritizing my work, and making adequate use of my weekends. If there is a class that releases homework for the week much earlier than its due, say on a weekend, I would attempt to do that homework as soon as possible depending on the length of the assignment.

The way I prioritized my work is by getting every piece of work that was urgent done as soon as possible. I also didn't do my best work for every assignment. That might sound like a bad thing to do to you, but in my opinion if you're spending a lot of time on an assignment that is worth very little of your grade, you're wasting your time. Take a lot of time and effort on important assignments, not small assignments. After I got urgent work done, I'd move on to doing work that was due further in the future and do as well as I could.

A typical prioritization strategy people use is the Eisenhower matrix, which you can see somewhere on your screen right now. You should search it up if you want to learn more about it.

Another thing you have to keep in mind, that I already kind of touched on is that if you're aiming to really do well with your college apps, you need to put  a little less effort into your school work and more effort into working on your extracurriculars. That's the only way you can manage to get enough sleep and do well on both. Now by less effort, I don't mean floundering. I mean do the minimum you need to get an A or whatever your target grade is which is probably an A if you're watching this video. Don't be a perfectionist, just turn in the minimum acceptable work for an A, you'll be fine, trust me.

## Learning To Say No

This also kind of falls under prioritization. It's also very simple. If your friends ask you to play basketball, game, or go out and you KNOW you have work to do today or you could get really ahead on work for some academic competition, extracurricular, or even just plain old school, say no. Tell them that you'll be free later but you'll have to be back so you can get in bed by 11 or 12, but you can't go now. Simple as that.
