- *Touches Grass* what is this?
- Yea, I started coding out the womb and I got my first internship with google at age 10
- So this is what our data looks like right now, i think it's best if we get a neural network to fit it *the picture is of a scatterplot of data in very obvious linear relation*
- Yeah I don't write comments for my code, I'll remember it when I have to look back on it, I mean I wrote the code, how could I forget?
- I personally think that writing code is an art form and that I'm picasso
- I personally think that writing code sucks and I never want to do it again
- Yeah, I don't talk to women because it gets rid of my competitive programming skills, gotta keep my mechanics ya know
- Yup I leetcoded for about 3 hours yesterday and got 2 easy problems done, feeling good
- Sure I played Valorant for 4 hours last night and procrastinated on all my work, but that doesn't mean I'm not doing things
- Yea, so my startup is basically going to innovate the way people look at their stuffed animals using AI, Machine Learning, and Blockchain. It's called UnAIcorn, get it? Like unicorn, but AI not I. Yea, it's clever.
- Picks up deodorant and throws it away while saying "I don't need this".
- Googles: "What is LeetCode"
- Googles: "What is a hashmap"
- Googles: "What is twosum"
- "Ok, so I got 4269 warnings, but zero errors, good enough for me!"
- I don't know why it isn't working on your computer, it works on my machine
- Googles: "What are people skills"
- "Ok, that didn't work, maybe if I run it again it'll work"
- Now I know I said I don't talk to girls because it would get rid of my mechanics, but why are there no girls in here?
- Yo, follow me on GitHub.
- In a dark room with no lights on except the really bright computer light and light mode on and say: "Why do my eyes hurt so much"
- Yea, I've started writing on Medium go follow me there.
- I've applied to 200 internships so far and gotten 0 interviews, if I apply to 800 more I'll probably get at least one.
- I hate coding.
