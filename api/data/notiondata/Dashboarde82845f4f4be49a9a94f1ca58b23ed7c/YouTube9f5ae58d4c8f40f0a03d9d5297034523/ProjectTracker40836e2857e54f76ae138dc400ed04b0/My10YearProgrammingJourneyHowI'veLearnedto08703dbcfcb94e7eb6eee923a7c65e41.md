# "Script"

## Intro

- Talk about how I've been coding for about ten years
- Talk about how it's been on and off and I've only been coding regularly for about 5 years now
- Mention how the video isn't really about what I've done but more so about the things I've learned in order to improve at coding and learn it quickly

## Part 1

- Talk about the language I started with and how I wasn't very consistent at learning at first which led to big problems obvioiusly.
- Mention the three tips I have to learning how to code efficiently
    - 1: Be consistent when learning. Stick to one language/framework and see it through its end.
    - 2: If you're a beginner, try an easy language or stack of languages to learn. Python or HTML/CSS/JS
    - 3: Don't fall into tutorial hell, build projects on your own and stop following tutorials word for word.

## Part 2

## Part 3
