## Intro

I've been coding and learning how to code for a pretty long time now and I've made a lot of mistakes along the way, and I'm sure I'll make many more as I go along. 

My name is Sid and I'm a first year Computer Science major here at Georgia Tech and I love making videos about programming, productivity and just vlogging my everyday life. If you're interested in that, then stick around. Anyways, let's get back to the point of the video.

I've made a lot of mistakes, and it's more efficient to learn from the mistakes of others so you can learn quicker. For that reason I'll be going through my three biggest mistakes that I made during my programming journey and how you should avoid them, because they are very common mistakes that beginner programmers and aspiring data scientists make.

## Mistake 1: Falling into Tutorial Hell

The first mistake I kept making as I learned how to code was continuously following tutorials word for word without ever putting my own spin on anything I was learning. I would search up a tutorial, follow it word for word, close out of the tutorial and then wonder why I hadn't learned anything.

Obviously, you won't learn anything if all you do is fall tutorials word for word and line by line, simply copying what they are doing because you're not coming up with any of your own ideas. The best way to learn anything is to struggle with a problem by yourself. When you're trying to learn math, sure you look at the example problems for a while, but then you move on and solve the exercises by YOURSELF.

You should be doing the same thing with programming and data science. Take a look at a few tutorials, but don't follow them word for word. Tweak the project slightly, maybe pick a different dataset or add a new feature to the app, but don't copy it word for word. Then when you're done, move on from the tutorials and apply what you learned to your own idea.

Build something from scratch without following a tutorial, of course you can google things and stack overflow, because that's part of the problem solving process. But don't rely on tutorials.

I'll also leave some links to helpful GitHub repositories like build-your-own-x and project based learning in the description down below.

## Mistake 2: Not Sticking with a Language or Topic

Early on in my programming journey and then when I was learning data science, I was unable to stick with the same language or topic for a period of time. I was very impatient and was trying to learn multiple languages at once, or I was just moving on quickly after learning one topic without letting it set in properly and getting enough practice with say, decision trees.

This was in part due to me completely self-studying and having no one to hold me accountable because it's not like I was studying for  school exams with classmates, I was just working on learning how to code by myself.

So, I would suggest trying to find someone like you who's learning how to code or do data science and then be partners with them. That way you can keep each other accountable and make sure you're not switching around too much. If you wanna find people that could be your partner, join my discord, link in the description and you can find someone to study coding together.

Other ways you can do this is by like forcing yourself into a school environment, get your parents to quiz you about your progress everyday or even your friends that don't code. Just find someone or something that can keep you accountable.

## Mistake 3: Not realizing that documentation exists

Another huge mistake I made while learning to code, and honestly I still make this mistake all the time was not reading the documentation for what I was learning and also not writing any documentation for my own code. A lot of the libraries or programming languages you'll be learning will have excellent documentation even though some will be pretty bad. 

Reading the documentation is a great way to deeply understand how a library or programming language work as they're usually detailed and come with really nice examples. It gives you ideas on the way the language or library is used, so you can be as "pythonic" or whatever if you're learning python for example.

Additionally, writing your own documentation is incredibly important. You might think you'll remember how your own code works when you revisit it, but trust me regardless of how clean and self-documenting your code is, it is better to write some comments explaining why you decided to keep a picture of a coconut in the files and why the code won't run without it. Trust me, your future self will thank you greatly. 

A great way to supplement whatever YouTube videos or courses you are following is to read the documentation on the topic that they covered, you'll gain a deeper understanding of it like I already mentioned and feel more comfortable when using those functions or features in your own large codebases.
