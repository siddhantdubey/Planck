## Intro

Hey everyone and welcome back to another video! My name is Sid and I like making videos about programming, math, productivity, and a lot more. Today, I'll be telling you guys about the time I hosted my own hackathon at school and how you can proceed to host your own hackathon at your school. I'll let you know the hardest parts of the process and give you some tips on how you would want to navigate them.

## Why should you host your own Hackathon?

First off all, why should you host your own hackathon? Why not just go to somebody else's hackathon and have fun there.

Well in my case, I hosted my own hackathon simply because I wanted to, to be honest. But seriously, I did it because in North Carolina there aren't really any hackathons solely for high schoolers. There are hackathons at the different colleges that are kinda sometimes open to high schoolers, but none solely for high schoolers, so the summer before my 11th grade year I decided I was going to host Unihacks at my high school so high schoolers could have a place to participate in Hackathons. 

In this video, I'll mostly talk about the Hackathon I hosted in 2021 during Covid as a virtual hackathon, because that was much larger scale than what I worked on hosting in 2020. Let me quickly say that it will be very hard and time consuming for you to do this all yourself, and you should try to find at least one other student to help you plan, and it would be even better if you could get the support of someone in your school administration to help you host the event.

## Initial Planning

So first off all, the first thing you need to do while preparing your hackathon is to create an organizing team and pick the format of your hackathon. Try to get a reasonably sized organizing team of like 4 people, we organized our hackathon with only 2 and it did get a bit stressful at times. And when picking your format, remember that making it full virtual is a lot easier than making it hybrid or in-person because you don't have to book an actual physical location which is usually quite troublesome.

Once you have that done, pick a date for your hackathon and duration. Pick a weekend in the year, preferably 4-5 months away from the current date to give yourself adequate time to plan, and then think about whether you want the hackathon to be 12,24,36,or 48 hours. 

Of course, at this point you should also choose who your hackathon is catered to. Is everybody welcome? Only high schoolers? Only college students? Only recent grads? You need to make sure you know what demographic is attending the hackathon so you can plan workshops and such for them as we go ahead.

Now that you have that done, here's what you're going to need to do. 

1. Make a Discord Server or Slack Channel for your hackathon
    1. Even if it is an in-person hackathon, you'll still do the majority of your communication for the event on Discord.
2. Make a Devpost for your event. Devpost is where hackers will submit their projects, so you'll need to make one and give your hackers enough time to sign up for it.
3. Make a website for your hackathon, the best way to get people to attend is to make a website and then have your registration form on the website. Make sure to ask for experience levels on the registration form!

To make it easier on your self, especially if you're in high school, try partnering with your school administration and host a hackathon only for your school if your school is relatively big. You can also try and convince them to host it for other high schoolers! Otherwise, you can go solo with just you and your own friends.

To get the word out about your hackathon, promote it on your social medias, use Devpost, and ask your teachers to inform other students!

## Fundraising

Ok, so every hackathon needs prizes and most of them have free things like T-shirts and stickers. To make that happen, you're going to need to get money from somewhere. Now there's a few ways to do this:

1. Become an MLH partner event! This will require you to interface with your school admin a little bit more but it is very useful. Being an MLH partner event gives you access to a thousand dollars, a bunch of tools and software to help you organize your event, legitimacy, and put your hackathon in the eyes of a lot of potential participants and a whole lot more!
    1. Doing it this way will make it easier for you to reach out to people who usually sponsor MLH events and get money for your event.
2. The 2nd way would be to just reach out to sponsors by yourself which is very hard to do, or to reach out to them using contacts in your school that may or may not exist. Again, this is quite hard.
3. You can also try doing a fundraiser, posting on neighborhood facebook groups, letting people in school know and asking them to tell their parents that you're looking for sponsors for an event that will draw in a good amount of people.

This step is hard and it'll take a lot of back and forth emails and phone calls, but you'll get it done eventually.

## Contacting Judges + Volunteers and Planning Workshops

As the date for the event draws nearer, you're going to want to find people to judge submissions as well as people to volunteer their time to help hackers out with technical questions that they might have. You should try to give yourself at least a month and a half to do this because people are busy and you'll likely need to reach out to people in many different waves in order to get exactly what you need. If you've gotten sponsors from a company already then try and ask them if they have any employees that would like to volunteer their time. 

ALSO, for judging make sure to have a comprehensive rubric and a point system where you clearly outline how many points somebody should get based on the level of their project. You have to do this so that your judges have something to go off and are using the same scale, otherwise your ratings are going to be really messed up.

Something else that you have to be doing is planning out workshops and events for your hackathon! Have a few workshops teaching new skills, and maybe 1 or 2 fun events like a tetris tournament or something. Of course, make sure that your workshops are at appropriate times and that you don't have too many of them, or else your hackers will lose interest and not attend as many as you would like.

## During The Event

During the event, you're going to need to be on call  basically the whole time, making sure that it is running smoothly, making sure that workshops are being ran on time, continuously monitoring the Discord or Slack, and honestly just being in as many places as you and your team can be. It'll be very hectic so make sure to take breaks when you can.

## After The Event

After the event, you should probably send out a post-event survey asking hackers for their feedback on the event and tips on how you could improve, so you can do better next year.
