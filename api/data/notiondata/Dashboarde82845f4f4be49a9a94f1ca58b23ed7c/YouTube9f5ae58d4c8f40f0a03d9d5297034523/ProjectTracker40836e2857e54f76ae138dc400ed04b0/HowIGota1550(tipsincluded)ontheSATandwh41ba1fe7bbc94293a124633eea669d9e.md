## Intro

Hey everybody, my name is Sid and in today's video I'll be talking to you guys about how you can get a 1550 out of 1600 on the SAT, which was my score. I got a 780 on the Reading/Writing section and a 770 on the Math section. So, let's talk about how you can get a score like this and then talk about why it probably doesn't matter as much as you think it does.

## Overall Study Plan + How Long

I didn't study too long for the SAT, I think I put in about a real month of work with 2ish hours spent studying every day. I didn't spend much or any time really on studying for the math portion. I do think that you can do really well on the SAT with just an hour a day every day for a month with a few practice tests thrown in.

## Reading/Writing

The reading/writing or English section is one that many people struggle with. I myself really struggled with the grammar portion of this section when I began preparing for the SAT. If you're watching this video you know that the 1st section is Reading Comprehension, and then the 2nd section is the writing portion which I call the grammar section. The reading portion consists of 4 passages and 52 questions in 65 minutes. The grammar section also consists of four passages, 44 questions total.

For the reading section, my personal strategy was just to read the passage once quickly and answer the questions, then if I had any doubts I went back and read the passage again. I got every question right, so obviously there was something right with this approach. Now there are many different ways to approach it, and some people like to read the questions first and then go to relevant portions in the passage, but I find that to be inefficient as it much quicker to read through the whole passage first.

For the grammar section, I have no crazy tips. It was just a lot of practice questions just like one would do for math and it worked pretty well as I only ended up getting one wrong in this section. The book I used to prep for the writing section was Erica L Meltzer's The Ultimate Guide to SAT Grammar, and for the reading section it was Erica L Meltzer's The Ultimate Guide to SAT Reading. The books are great and do have great practice questions as well.

I also used Khan Academy's practice for both mini exercises and full length practice tests, all of which are free.

## Math

I personally didn't study any new concepts for the Math portion of the test because I didn't need to. All I did was do full length practice tests and see how I did on the math sections, I usually got 0 to 3 questions wrong each time, so I simply did not do any extra practice. On the actual exam, I got 2 questions wrong across the entire math section I believe, both of which were silly mistakes that wouldn't have happened if I took a little bit more time on the problems instead of rushing through them. Anyways, I would suggest just going through all the exercises on the Khan Academy in their SAT section and just practicing a LOT, because that really is the only way to get good at Math.

## Why It Doesn't Matter

I personally don't think SAT scores matter all that much. As long as you're around the 50th percentile for schools you're applying to you'll be good. I doubt anyone gets rejected for having a 1510 instead of a 1540 or a 1550 instead of a 1600. Additionally, many many schools are going test-optional for at least this application cycle and maybe many more to come. You won't be penalized for not submitting test scores, although I would still recommend submitting an SAT score if you happen to have a high one. 

Now although I say I don't think it matters all that much, you should still definitely study for the exam. You have everything to gain by doing really well and nothing to lose so just go for it.
