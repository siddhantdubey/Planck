## Intro

We've all been there, you're on a tear of productivity and it seems like nothing in the world can stop you. Then one day you wake up and you really don't feel like doing anything, then one day turns into two turns into three, and before you know it you're wasting time like sand slipping through your fingers. In this video I'll talk about how I tend to get myself out of these slumps, because I've been in one for about a month now and I'll also mention some things I'll be trying to help me avoid these slumps in the future. I watched a video by Wheezy Waiter last night where he talked about a similar topic, so you should probably watch that video too and I'll leave a link to it in the description of this video. 

## How To Get Out of a Slump

So I've been in a slump for a month I think. I've been feeling a little bit burned out by the idea of "making content", and that I can say comes from a "lack of motivation". I definitely still wanted to make content, but it was now a little bit harder to do so since I was at college rather than at home in my bedroom where I wouldn't get interrupted. I would have to find a new place to film, because my dorm room is way too cramped to film in comfortably, and schedule in filming around all my other activities that I would be doing in college. Clearly, I overcame that because I'm filming this video, but what I'm trying to say is that for me burnout and productivity slumps happen when I have random new obstacles placed in my life. When something disrupts your normal habits, you're likely to fall into a slump. I've had this happen with school and academic work before as well.

So how do you get out of that slump? Well here's what works for me, and this won't work for everybody but hopefully it helps you out at least a little bit! 

So step number one is pretty simple, just take a break. Take a few days off of whatever it is you are doing. Relax, recharge and allow yourself to put some distance in between you and your work. 

Step two is rebuilding your habits a little bit at a time. You won't be able to get back to peak productivity immediately and you'll have to phase back into it. Start by working on your homework for 30 minute chunks with breaks or whatever other work you have and then bring that number up to what you were peaking at before your slump. Also do remember that productivity ebbs and flows and your end goal in life shouldn't to be the most productive person that ever was. If you want to know a lot more about building good habits I'll leave links to some good resources like Atomic Habits in the description

Tip number 3 is an add on to tip number 1. Hang out with your friends, and you'll feel better. Play video games, play basketball, idk just do something that isn't work!

Tip number 4 is to allow yourself time to relax and do random stuff like game, it'll improve your productivity.

And if you're finding it hard to be motivated to do something even after building habits to do that thing over a long period of time, then that's fine because your habits will push you to do it even after you've run out of motivation to do a certain task.

## How I Plan On Not Getting Into a Productivity Slump Again

Here's how I plan on avoiding productivity slumps forever. Keyword here being plan, because I will definitely slump again, but hopefully not very badly. 

1. I want to get to the point where I can simply abandon projects that I am no longer interested in.
2. Given that 1. is a pipe dream, I want to build strong enough habits such that "motivation" is no longer something that would stop me from getting work done. Of course, there are other things that affect what you can get done such as your mental health, but good habits can help you get stuff done.
3. I will take breaks. When I sense myself becoming a little irritated, I will not push myself past a breaking point, I will simply take a few days off preemptively. I'll just stop thinking about work for a bit and enjoy myself and come back with a clear mind.

That's all I really can do to make sure that I don't get into burnout again, but it's not something that I can guarantee will happen. I mean there's really only so much control you can have on your own productivity and I think the most important productivity thing one can internalize is that sometimes there will be things outside your control that will wreck your productivity and that's ok. A good habits system will help you be resilient to outside scenarios, but even then sometimes you won't be super productive and that's OK! Life isn't about being productive.
