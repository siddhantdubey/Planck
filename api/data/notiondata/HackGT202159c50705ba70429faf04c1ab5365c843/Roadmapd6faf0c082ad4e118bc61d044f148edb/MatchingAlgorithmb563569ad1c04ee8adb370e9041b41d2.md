# Matching Algorithm

Status: In progress

# User Data

- Get user top songs and artists
    - Over period of 4 weeks

## What We Do

- Using user's top songs, we assign them a few top genres
- Using both the songs and genres we find people similar to those genres and songs
    - How to determine similarity???
        - Same top song (highest weight)
        - Same top artist
        - Similar genres (will come up with metric for weighting this)
- Match people with others that are similar
- Move on to messaging and groups
