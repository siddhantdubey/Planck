# Newsletter

## What is it?
My newsletter is what I use to communicate with my core audience and direct them to my week's work and upcoming projects that I am actively working on. This includes YouTube videos, Articles, Twitter Threads, and Software Side Projects.

Contains my thoughts on the week's happenings in tech as well as just general life and productivity tips.
