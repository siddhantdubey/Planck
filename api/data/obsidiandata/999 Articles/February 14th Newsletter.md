# Newsletter Changes

Hello friends,

First off, I've decided to make the newsletter biweekly instead of weekly to allow myself time to curate good content for the newsletter (this edition won't have ton of that, my bad) and also to hopefully stop the clutter in your inbox from the ton of newsletters you've probably signed up to. Unfortunately, this week's newsletter will also be short due to a lack of content that I've made and consumed over the last two weeks. In fact, that's all I really have for the week, regular content will start appearing the week of the 22nd. 

Thanks,

Sid
