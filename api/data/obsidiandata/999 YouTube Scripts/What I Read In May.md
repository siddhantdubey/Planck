## Script

Books. There's a lot of them, and it's been a while since I've touched one. May was the month that I decided I should probably get back into reading, and I’m happy I made that decision. I spent May getting back into the wonderful world of books and I ended up reading some really really good pieces of work. I spent most of my time reading fiction, but a non-fiction book did manage to sneak itself into my hands.

**Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut**

Kurt Vonnegut is one of my favorite writers, and I’ve read Cat’s Cradle quite a few times. I decided to read it again in May, and I’m glad I did. It’s a great book that employs humor effectively to talk about things like science, technology, and religion. I don’t usually laugh out loud when I’m reading a book, and I didn’t for this one but it was pretty funny. It’s a really fun read and the book doesn’t really have chapters, but rather episodes that capture series of moments that come together to tell a story. I love the way the book talks about religion and belief. It really made me thonk, if you will and it was such a fun read and it is definitely something I’ll come back to as the years go on. GO READ IT!

**To Die in Benares by K Madavane**

To Die in Benares by K Madavane is a collection of short stories that tackle topics from colonialism to religion to death and all the short stories are absolutely wonderful. K Madavane was an Indian author who grew up in Pondicherry under French colonialism. To Die in Benares was actually originally written in French, and only translated into English around 10 years ago. Most of the short stories are also incredibly dark and depressing, not really mincing any words when it comes to talking about death but they are great reads. The scenery is vivid, painting the banks of the Ganges onto the theater screen in your mind and allowing you to get a feel for a place that is so sacred to so many people because of the wonders and importance of dying a good death. I’d suggest everybody to check this book out and read it because it is a pleasure.

**Shadow of the Gods by John Gwynne**

This is another great fantasy book and I loved reading it. I demolished it in a few days because of how quickly it drew me in and kept me hooked. It’s a loosely Norse-inspired kind of vengeance novel set in a world whose gods died long ago, but rumors are that they won’t be dead for long. When the gods died, the bones and artifacts they left behind become magical items that are extremely valuable. Bands of mercenaries and for-hire treasure hunters roam the land seeking these artifacts and hunting down the children of the gods who are treated as subhuman and punished for the crimes of the gods. The book itself follows three main protagonists, Orka, Varg, and Elvar, who you are introduced to in that order. All of these protagonists have suffered greatly, just like everybody else in this fairly grimdark world, and their stories as you progress draw you in incredibly well. Gwynne’s character work is absolutely incredible and you become attached to every single character in the book by either hating them, loving them, or being intrigued by them. Even if a character is on screen for only a few pages, they seem real to you. Not much more I can say without ruining the joy of the book, well joy isn’t the right word because it is so so so depressing, but the book is incredibly well done and you need to go read it now, it is so good.

**The Almanack of Naval Ravikant**

This was the one non-fiction book I read this month and it had quite a few good bits of wisdom. It’s a compilation of Naval’s blog posts, Twitter threads, and podcast interviews put together in a coherent way to take inspiration from. It has helpful tips on building wealth and happiness that I enjoyed and although I don’t agree with everything in the book, it was definitely a good collection of advice from the mouth of a very successful man.

**American Gods by Neil Gaiman**

As I write this, I see that I had a common theme this month of reading books about gods and religion. American Gods is a great fantasy book and a great book in general. It follows an ex-con named Shadow after he gets out of prison. The day he leaves prison, he finds out that his wife was killed in a car crash, and he ends up meeting a God named Mr. Wednesday, which isn’t his real name and you can probably figure out what his real name is if you think a little bit about Norse Mythology. Anyways, I can’t really spill too much about the book without ruining the experience but it really is a great book that talks about the rise of new religions in America and the falling off the cultures and old religions that people brought with them to America the first time they came over. Some of the references and parts of the book haven’t aged the best, but it is still a great read and you should probably go and read it right now.

**Conclusion**
