### Introduction

Hey friends, I'm Sid, a high school senior currently suffering from acute senioritis. To push my senioritis to bay, I realized that I have a YouTube channel and I'm back to making videos. In this video I'll be talking about why I love to read Sci-Fi Fantasy and if you're here for programming content, I'll have something up in the next week!

I like reading. Sure, I don't get around to reading as much as I would like to these days but it's still one of my favorite ways to spend time. As somebody who likes to pride themselves on being "productive", there was a period of time where I was swayed to believe that reading anything but non-fiction books was a waste of my efforts. I think that this is a symptom of a larger problem, some people get so dialed in on being "productive", that they deem anything that isn't perceived as serious a waste of time.

Now, I'm somebody who loves a good non-fiction book but to me, nothing can compare to the joy of reading a Sci-Fi Fantasy work. I love being able to get invested into the lives of fictional characters in different but similar worlds to our own. Reading Fantasy books helps me have fun and relax. It definitely does not take away from my productivity. 

I think looking at books from a purely utilitarian point of view (or anything for that matter) is odd. But enough about the self-help gurus telling you to read only self-help books, let's talk about why I read Fantasy and perhaps as a whole, Fiction. Warning, much corniness lies ahead, you may cringe, but you'll get my honest opinions. And hey, if you end up not cringing or enjoy it, consider subscribing!


### Main Talking Section

So why is Fantasy my favorite genre? In very simple words, I love getting invested into worlds that aren't my own. Authors that are great at wordbuilding like Tolkien or Brandon Sanderson draw me in and I end up spending hours at a time reading their books. And yes, Brandon Sanderson fans and their love of his worldbuilding is a bit of a meme, but I still love it. 

Reading series like the *Stormlight Archive*, set on a fictional planet with a rich and interesting setting that contributes to an even more interesting story makes me feel happy. A good writer can put rich images of their story in your head, and I find that to be an enriching experience. 

Many critics of the Fantasy genre claim that that the genre is oversaturated and the stories are the same with the exact same characters. This in my opinion, is a stupid opinion. Sure, there's a ton of sci-fi fantasy novels that follow essentially the same plot, but there's also a ton of fresh novels with unique premises, wonderful worlds, and compelling characters. Boiling the whole genre down to the same plot is decidedly unfair, and not a very smart thing to say. 

Second, people claim that they're often too long and not well written. Which definitely is the case sometimes, no offense Mr. Sanderson but there's places where you can cut down on your page count. However, there's also quite a few authors who deliver nice fast paced action fantasy if that's what you're into, like Evan Winter and his book The Rage of Dragons, which is absolutely amazing and you should check it out. If it's wonderful prose you're looking for, read Patrick Rothfuss' the Name of the Wind, the final book of the trilogy is bound to come out sometime this century. 

Thirdly, some people claim that fantasy novels rarely *mean anything*. What this means I'm not particularly sure, but I'll assume it means that they're not "deep". For fear of sounding like a shill, I'll restrain from going off but there's plenty of fantasy novels that'll make you think and make you feel things intensely. There's plenty of fantasy novels that have great prose, a great story, a great world, great dialogue, and make you think about your life in relation to the story you're consuming. But books don't need to have all of that or any of that except maybe a great story to be worth someone's time. As long as you're having fun reading it, it's a good book to at least you. Genre snobbery needs to go, but there's plenty of videos and articles and books on that topic already, so I don't have to talk about what's already been said.

### Where Do You Get Started?

If my poorly constructed rant has somehow convinced you to perhaps give fantasy a shot, then here's a few starting points I would suggest. I'll also have them all in the description down below along with a link to my discord, twitter, and other social media, so follow me on those and subscribe if you want to keep up to date with the content I put out on this YouTube channel! 

I would suggest getting started with the Rage of Dragons by Evan Winter, it's an amazing story about a young man with a single minded focus on revenge. It's fast paced, action packed, and extremely entertaining. I would also recommend reading the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. The first book can be thought of as a classic heist story with much larger stakes and people have magic powers they get from using metals like drugs! It's a fun read, albeit a little long, and it'll take you on a ride of emotions. Of course, you could also never go wrong with reading The Lord of the Rings. I just prefer more modern Fantasy.
