## Script

I think I'll have 3 Key Takeaways to talk about

1. Julia is awesome! But, so is Python!
	- Both languages are super fun to work with but I still feel a lot more comfortable working with Python.
2. Being able to answer questions with data is fun!
3. You can learn so much in a fairly short time.
