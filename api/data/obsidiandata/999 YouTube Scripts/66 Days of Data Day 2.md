# 66 Days of Data Day 2: Introduction to Julia and Why I picked Julia

- Introduction
	- Hey friends and welcome back to another video on my YouTube channel. For those of you who are new here, my name is Sid and I'm a high school senior that loves all things Computer Science. I make videos about Machine Learning, Competitive Programming, General Software Development, and Productivity, so if you enjoy any of those topics then consider subscribing. According to YouTube analytics only a small percentage of my viewers are subscribed, so subscribe to raise that percentage. It's free and you can always unsubscribe. Anyways, this video is part of my video series entitled "66 Days of Data" in which I spend 66 days learning data science concepts every day in the hopes that I'll come out of the 66 days a better data scientist. If you want to know more, I'll link my video from the first day as well as Ken Jee's video as he's really the guy that came up with the idea of 66 days of data.


- Why Julia:
	- So let's talk about why I picked Julia instead of Python for these 66 days.
	- I picked Julia for this challenge because it is a language that was created with scientific computing in mind and because it'll give me a little bit of a break from working with Python. I still love Python but Julialang is just as easy to write code in and that code runs faster than it does in Python which is a huge bonus. It's just that I've been working on Python things for a lot of time and I feel like there's not a whole lot more I want to do with the language right now. I still use it every day though.
- What I did today:
	- Yesterday I wandered into Julia, watched a few videos about the philosophy of the language and learned a little bit of syntax.
	- Today I delved deeper into the jungle of Julia syntax, if you know a scripting language like Python/R then learning Julia syntax isn't a hard task. There are a few differences between Julia and Python syntax but it still is an easy enough switch.
	- Julia starts indexing at 1 so that's tripped me more times than I could care to admit today, but it'll be something that I'll get used to quick enough, as I'm also currently learning and using Matlab for a Physics course I'm taking.
	- Some things I really like about Julia so far:
		- It being a language that's compiled means its faster and I greatly appreciate a language with speed, which is why I do competitive programming in C++.
		- Being able to write functions inline is making creating mathematical functions a lot easier for me as a programmer and just easier to read for others who will eventually read codebases I've made (I hope). I'm still very much a Julia beginner so this opinion might just be wrong.
		- Ending code blocks with the end keyword and not having to use a colon to signify the beginning of a new codeblock is interesting and reminds me a lot of Ruby and the syntatic sugar that is is particularly sweet.
		- I also haven't started doing any Linear Algebra/Machine Learning stuff with the language yet and that is where it really excels so I'm super excited to do that.
	- Things I don't really about Julia so far:
		- Arrays start indexing at 1, this is really just me being slow to adapt because at the end of the day this doesn't really alter the bottom line and just makes the code more easily readable by a non-programmer, which is something that I think is extremely valuable.
- Other things
	- In other data science related tasks, I worked on my script for a video I'm making that's going to be an animated explanation of Gini Impurity and Decision Trees. Decision Trees are my favorite Machine Learning algorithm and I'm excited to make the video about them. I'm also planning on starting with Machine Learning with Julia sometime this week and I hope that'll give me a new perspective on the basic algorithms which in turn will hopefully let me make better videos for you guys!

- Sellout Conclusion
	- I hoped you guys enjoyed this video and the idea of 66daysofdata enough to embark on your own 66 days of data or 100 days of code journey.
