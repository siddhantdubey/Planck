# Machine Learning and Education

## Is Machine Learning Just Statistics

- No. 
- The way Machine Learning is approached and thought about is different from the way Statistics is approached and thought about so they're different things. Just like it isn't fair to say that Game Theory is just statistics, it isn't fair to say that Machine Learning is just statistics. - [[Charles Isbell]]

## Data's Importance compared to Algorithm

- "The view of a computational statistician and the view of the computer scientist/software engineer will be different from each other" - [[Charles Isbell]]
- "If you don't program it, you don't understand it. I think this is wrong, it is a very software engineer way of looking at things." - [[Charles Isbell]]
- "The data matters more than almost anything. Worry about the data, not the algorithm. Worry about the questino the data is answering, not the question you think it is answering." - [[Charles Isbell]]

## The Role of Hardship in Education

- The role of a teacher is to be a curator. In a way, teachers prune the search space of education. 
- I personally find it more rewarding to struggle with a problem and find the solution on my own than to have stuff handed to me. 
- [[Lex Fridman]] feels the same way, but that's in part to his russian way of thinking. 
- [[Michael Littman]] says that there's a difference in the waays of suffering, you can be suffering in a hopeless way or suffering in a hopeful way. The former is bad for education, but the latter is a great way to learn. 
- Different schools have different ways of approaching education. 
- Students at MIT and GTech and schools like that have the ethos of "I hate being here and I'm proud of it." Schools like Brown and Yale are a bit more coddling.
- Georgia Tech had a prove you can't drown requirement to graduate, you get pushed into the water and you had to survive. Georgia Tech's education philosophy is to see how much you can be pushed before you break. "Building tomorrow tonight"- [[Charles Isbell]]

## How Charles Isbell and Michael Littman Met

- Charles was working at [[Bell Labs]] when Michael Littman was being interviewed. 
- That is where they met the first time. 
- After they all got laid off from Atnt labs, they got assigned a project to work on together that was deemed "useful".
- Creating an automated assistant was the task, there was no time and it wouldn't have saved them so it all went downhill. 
- This was the failed project that was eventually taken to DARPA and became CALO which became Siri!
- They spent a lot of time in Littman's office.

## The Key to Success
- Never be satisfied. 
- You'll be dissatisfied with your work sometimes. You need to be ok with the fact that you're improving but you must realize that you're not there yet. [[Charles Isbell]]
- You need to separate yourself from your work. Being critical of myself is something I do, but I'm quite often excited about my work. [[Michael Littman]]

## Bell Labs

- [[Lex Fridman]]: "Why was it so magical?"
- [[Michael Littman]]: "Great managers, people that believed in Machine Learning."
- [[Charles Isbell]]: "It was a bit more than that."
- Bell Labs was an arm of the government.
- "A University, but without students. Faculty would work together." - [[Charles Isbell]]
- Bell Labs was magical, a watermark on basic research in the United States.

## Teaching Machine Learning

- 7642 was a class they taught about reinforcement learning. 
- Working together was how they kept the energy up teaching a MOOC instead of sitting and looking straight at a screen and making jokes to no crowd.
