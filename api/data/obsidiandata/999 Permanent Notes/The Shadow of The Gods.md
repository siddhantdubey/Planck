# Review

## Characters
Really well written, get attached to them very quickly. 
Main protagonists (ranked in terms of how i liked them at the beginning):
- Orka (Understand motivations, very cool character)
- Varg (Understand motivations, very cool character)
- Elvar (Do not understand motivations, pretty annoying tbh)

## Worldbuilding
Quite nice, don't have a ton of details about the world, but I am used to Sanderson worldbuilding and not everybody does that so it's fine. His settings are pretty fleshed out and I can imagine myself in those places.

## Plot
This at the beginning feels like a book more motivated by the interesting characters rather than some overarching mega plot, but I haven't finished it yet so.
