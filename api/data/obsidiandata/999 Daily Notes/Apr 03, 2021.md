Morning Brain Dump:
- I really need to finish my assignments, so I'll spend today focusing on getting my Digital Humanities project done and then if I have free time, I'll move on with the React course I'm taking. If I feel too tired after hw, I'll just play Valorant the rest of the day.

Daily Notes:
- Woke up pretty late at 11 AM
- Ate good food for lunch
- Organized data for the digihum project and made nice looking visualizations
- Posted 2 Tiktoks.
