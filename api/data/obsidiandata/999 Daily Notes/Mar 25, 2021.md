Morning Brain Dump:
- I'm just thinking about content I can make and how I want to make it. 
- I need to start making videos and writing more regularly and also start coding more regularly as well.
- This is all very important to build a good future, and I need to grind grind grind. 
- Plus all of that is also quite fun to do, so it won't be too much of a problem if I can get over the initial inertia of not wanting to do any work.

Daily Notes:
- Woke up pretty late at 8 AM.


Nightly Reflection: 
- A reflection of the day's happenings.
