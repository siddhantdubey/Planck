I am grateful for: Family

To-Dos:
- [x] Find equations of motion for system
- [x] Model the equations in Simulink

- [ ] Princeton Interview
- [ ] Film Day 4 and 5 of 66 Days of Data (1 Video) and Upload it
- [ ] Write twitter thread summarizing the video and linking to it
- [ ] Potentially make TikTok


Morning Brain Dump:
- I'm really focused on getting my Dynamic Systems final project finished today. I also want to catch up on my [[66 Days of Data]] videos because I slacked off yesterday which is no bueno. Depending on what e-mails I get, I'll also have to work on the Hackathon, even though I kind of don't want to today.

Daily Notes:
- Woke up very late at like 8:40-8:50, I really want to fix this. I also got into UNC Charlotte this morning, bringing my acceptances up to a grand total of three which is awesome.


Nightly Reflection: 
- A reflection of the day's happenings.
