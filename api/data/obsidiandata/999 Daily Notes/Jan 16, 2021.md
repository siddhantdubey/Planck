Morning Brain Dump:
- I woke up late, really only focused on getting Hackathon and J-Term work done today.

Daily Notes:
- Woke up late, then emailed volunteers before we left to see a new house at around 1:40.
- Came back from house hunting, sat down and wrote out my To-Dos on obsidian, then setup zoom links.
- Then proceeded to tutor, film tiktok, and write newsletter.
- Had dinner and watched TV, came back and did Matlab Simulation.
- Then I played Valorant, raged, and went to sleep at around 11:30 PM.


Nightly Reflection: 
- Overall, it was a pretty productive day. 
- I ended up raging too hard at Valorant at the end of the day, but it is what it is.
