Morning Brain Dump:
- I am thinking about ways to grow my audience as well as my monthly income. This is something that'll take a good bit of work, but I think if I grind until the end of summer, I should see some good results. I'm super excited about getting to work on things I enjoy both at school and in my own time every day, so this should be a great way to get started.
