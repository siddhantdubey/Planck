Morning Brain Dump:
- I had a pretty weird nightmare last night. All I'm really thinking about right now is my college decisions, making YouTube videos, and playing Valorant. I need to devote more time to working on my YouTube videos and I will do so moving forward, because I really want to grow an audience so that I can kind of keep YouTube as a side income source. Hopefully, I'll also be able to attain some patrons on patreon!

Daily Notes:
- I woke up at 9:03 AM, which is very late and I don't like it.
- Learned how to use Simulink and MatLab


Nightly Reflection: 
- Today was a pretty good day, learned some interesting things in class while also grinding valorant for a good amount. Got to bed quite early tonight which was good.
- Not much done in the ways of advancing my social media profiles.
