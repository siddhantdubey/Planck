Daily Notes:
- I dreamnt about getting into Harvard before I woke up today. The decision letter in the dream was very convoluted and didn't even say congratulations until the last sentence but then I looked back up and it had changed to congratulations on your acceptance from "view your decision letter". Don't really know what that means, it would be pretty cool to get into Harvard though lol. 


Nightly Reflection: 
- A reflection of the day's happenings.
