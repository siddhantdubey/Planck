Morning Brain Dump:
- Today's the day MIT Decisions come out, so there's some big stuff on that front today, but in other news I'm also quite interested in making content and getting on the grind, so I'll see how that develops as we get along with the remainder of the month. I'm hoping to be able to make some TikToks that catch on and lead traffic to my YouTube channel, because that would honestly be great.
