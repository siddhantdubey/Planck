# A Project a Month (YouTube Series Idea)

- I make a project a month and make a YouTube video about it. 
- The projects would be data analysis, software development, and other things.
- This page won't have any of the ideas, but I'll link back to this on the YT vids when I make projects for this.
- This'll force me to show my work, which is something very important and also help to boost my GitHub profolio to become more hireable.
